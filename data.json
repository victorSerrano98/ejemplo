        "context": "Objective: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak that began in China has turned into a pandemic that threatens global health, thereby prompting the concentration of studies and clinical routines on treating and preventing the disease. However, research on the psychological effects of the pandemic on the general population, particularly pregnant women, is lacking. Accordingly, the present study investigated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on depression and anxiety in pregnant women.Study design: An anonymous survey for assessing depression and anxiety in pregnant women was designed, after which a link to the online questionnaire was sent to the participants, who were being treated in a private medical center. One of the researchers followed up with the respondents, among whom 260 returned their questionnaires.Results: Among the respondents, 35.4% (n\u2009=\u200992, case group) obtained scores higher than 13 on the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS). The comparison of the groups by years of education indicated statistically significant effects of COVID-19 on psychology, social isolation, and mean scores in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). These effects were more severe in the case group than in the control group (psychology: 8.369\u2009\u00b1\u20092.003, social isolation: 8.000\u2009\u00b1\u20092.507, mean BDI and BAI scores: 20.565\u2009\u00b1\u20096.605 and 22.087\u2009\u00b1\u20098.689, respectively). A regression analysis revealed that the BDI scores and the disease's psychological effects, as well as the BAI scores and the illness's social isolation effects, exerted a statistically significant influence on the EPDS scores of the participants.Conclusion: This study illustrated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the depression and anxiety levels of pregnant women. Our results point to an urgent need to provide psychosocial support to this population during the crisis. Otherwise, adverse events may occur during pregnancy and thus affect both mother and fetus."

Using prospective cohorts of health care personnel, first responders, and other essential and frontline workers* in eight U.S. locations during December 14, 2020-March 13, 2021, CDC routinely tested for SARS-CoV-2 infections every week regardless of symptom status and at the onset of symptoms consistent with COVID-19-associated illness. Among 3,950 participants with no previous laboratory documentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2,479 (62.8%) received both recommended mRNA doses and 477 (12.1%) received only one dose of mRNA vaccine.\u2020 Among unvaccinated participants, 1.38 SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) per 1,000 person-days.\u00a7 In contrast, among fully immunized (\u226514 days after second dose) persons, 0.04 infections per 1,000 person-days were reported, and among partially immunized (\u226514 days after first dose and before second dose) persons, 0.19 infections per 1,000 person-days were reported. Estimated mRNA vaccine effectiveness for prevention of infection, adjusted for study site, was 90% for full immunization and 80% for partial immunization. These findings indicate that authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are effective for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of symptom status, among working-age adults in real-world conditions. COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for all eligible persons."

Understanding the mediators between personality and stress is critical for developing effective stress management interventions during a pandemic. Our study explored whether perceptions of threat from COVID-19 and efficacy to follow government recommendations for preventing COVID-19 would mediate the relationships between personality traits (e.g., neuroticism, conscientiousness-goal-striving, extroversion-activity and sociability) and perceived stress. In an online survey of a representative sample of Canadian adults (n\u202f=\u202f1055), we found that higher neuroticism and extroversion were associated with higher levels of stress during the pandemic and a greater increase in stress levels compared to levels before the pandemic. Perceived threat and efficacy significantly mediated the relationship between neuroticism and stress, which suggested that individuals with higher neuroticism experienced higher levels of stress due to higher levels of perceived threat and lower levels of efficacy. Perceived threat did not mediate the relationship between extroverts and stress, which suggested that the source of stress may stem from elsewhere (e.g., inability to socialize). Our findings highlighted that personality traits could be an important factor in identifying stress-prone individuals during a pandemic and that stress management interventions need to be personality specific.\n \n"

Hence, the situation demands an immediate need to explore all the plausible therapeutic and prophylactic strategies that can be made available to stem the spread of the disease. Towards this effort, the current review outlines the key aspects of the pathobiology associated with the morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients, which includes a viral response phase and an exaggerated host response phase. The review also summarizes therapeutic agents that are currently being explored along with those with potential for consideration. The broad groups of therapeutic agents discussed include those that: (i) block viral entry to host cells, (ii) block viral replication and survival in host cells, and (iii) dampen exaggerated host immune response. The various kinds of pharmaceutical prophylactic options that may be followed to prevent COVID-19 have also been discussed."

The study about features of this infection could be very helpful in better knowledge about this infectious disease. The current systematic review and meta-analysis were aimed to estimate the prevalence of clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods A systematic review using Medline/PubMed, Scopus, and Google scholar has been conducted. In the current systematic review and meta-analysis, the articles published in the period January 1, 2020, to April 2, 2020, written in English and reporting clinical symptoms of COVID-19 was reviewed. To assess, the presence of heterogeneity, the Cochran\u2019s Q statistic, the I2 index, and the tau-squared test were used. Because of significant heterogeneity between the studies the random-effects model with 95% CI was used to calculate the pooled estimation of each symptom prevalence. Results The most common symptoms in COVID-19 patients include: Fever 81.2% (95% CI: 77.9-84.4); Cough: 58.5% (95% CI: 54.2-62.8); Fatigue 38.5% (95% CI: 30.6-45.3); Dyspnea: 26.1% (95% CI: 20.4-31.8); and the Sputum: 25.8% (95% CI: 21.1-30.4). Based on the meta-regression results, the sample size used in different studies did not have a significant effect on the final estimate value (P > 0.05). Conclusions Considering the main symptoms of COVID-19 such as Fever, Cough, Fatigue, and Dyspnea can have a key role in early detection of this disease and prevent the transmission of the disease to other people."

Setting Ambulatory, nonhospitalized patients who were quarantined in a designated hotel for COVID-19 patients and were recruited by an advertisement at the hotel. Subjects and Methods In total, 140 patients participated in a web-based questionnaire assessing initial symptoms of common viral diseases, olfactory and taste functions, xerostomia, and orofacial pain. Results A total of 58 men and 70 women participated. Initial symptoms were cough (59.4%), weakness (47.7%), myalgia (46.9%), fever (42.2%), headache (40.6%), impaired sense of smell (38.3%), impaired sense of taste (32.8%), sore throat (26.6%), runny nose (26.6%), and nasal congestion (22.7%). All symptoms were more frequent among women; however, only runny nose was statistically significant (P = .018). The most common combination of symptoms was cough and weakness (37.5%). A total of 25.8% reported olfactory and taste dysfunctions in the absence of other symptoms. In a comparison between the sexes, cough and runny nose were the most common combination in women (P = .018). A total of 38.3% of patients reported olfactory dysfunction as an initial symptom. Anosmia and facial pain were more common among women (P < .001 and P = .01, respectively), and 56% of patients reported xerostomia. Conclusion A considerable number of patients presented with olfactory and oral disorders. Interestingly, women presented with a different cluster of symptoms than men, which may suggest a new clinical approach to diagnosing COVID-19 disease."

The epidemiological picture is constantly evolving, and on 13 May, 4,170,424 cases and 287,399 confirmed deaths have been reported (WHO Report). People with COVID-19 infection may show several symptoms, including fever, cough, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, arthralgia, headache, diarrhea, and rarely arthritis [1]. COVID-19 clinical features range from asymptomatic patients to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction [2, 3]. Influenza symptoms are associated with a cascade of inflammatory mediators. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) levels in plasma and upper respiratory secretions directly correlate with the magnitude of viral replication, fever, and respiratory and systemic symptoms, including musculoskeletal clinical manifestations [4, 5] Musculoskeletal symptoms such as fatigue, myalgia and arthralgia are common COVID-19 symptoms, but their prevalence has not yet been systematically investigated [6, 7]. We collected the published clinical data of the past 5 months to ascertain the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms and epidemiological characteristics published worldwide in COVID-19 patients. Data were tabulated using Microsoft Excel 2020 V.16.34. The value was showed as mean \u00b1 SD. Student t test was used to reveal musculoskeletal symptoms between the total sample. To assess the incidence for each clinical variable, frequency analysis was performed. Regression analysis (R) was used to examine correlations between the total sample and musculoskeletal symptoms extracted. The level of significant was set at p < 0.05. The relevant reference and the data collected from the included articles are indicated in Tables 1 and 2. Data on 12,046 patients (54% male and 46% females) were available. The number of patients in the selected studies ranged from 5 to 1590 patients (223 \u00b1 312 patients). The sex ratio (male to female) was 1:15, and the overall average of patients was 52.13 years. The majority of the studies arose from China, mainly from Wuhan; one was from Singapore [57], two from Europe [46, 59], one from the USA [36], and one from Bolivia [58]. Musculoskeletal symptoms were present from the earliest stage of the viral illness and were reported in patients necessitating intensive care in the end stage of the condition. The total prevalence of fatigue symptom was 25.6% (R =0.56; p value = 0.004), while the prevalence of arthralgia and/or myalgia was 15.5% (R = 0.66; p value = 0.001; Fig. 1). Eight studies reported a prevalence higher than 50% of patients with fatigue [8, 9, 24, 25, 28, 37, 46, 47], while three studies reported higher values for arthralgia/myalgia symptoms [50, 53, 59]. The prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in studies from Europe reached high values [46, 59]; Lechien et al., for example, reported on 417 COVID-19 patients from 12 European hospitals and found myalgia in 246 (59%) and arthralgia in 129 (31%) of these patients [59]. Clinical presentation of COVID-19 ranges from absence of symptoms to severe pneumonia. Fever, dry cough and fatigue are common symptoms, as indeed are myalgia and arthralgia [6, 53]. Most of the articles are retrospective single center studies: data were collected in a non-homogeneous way, especially regarding comorbidities, lifestyle habits, and severity of the illness. Based on our work, we cannot state, for example, whether children and younger patients less commonly present musculoskeletal symptoms at onset [63].

If patients with symptoms quickly underwent testing and contact tracing, these outbreaks could be contained. Unfortunately, COVID-19 patients have symptoms similar to other common illnesses. Here, we hypothesize the order of symptom occurrence could help patients and medical professionals more quickly distinguish COVID-19 from other respiratory diseases, yet such essential information is largely unavailable. To this end, we apply a Markov Process to a graded partially ordered set based on clinical observations of COVID-19 cases to ascertain the most likely order of discernible symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea) in COVID-19 patients. We then compared the progression of these symptoms in COVID-19 to other respiratory diseases, such as influenza, SARS, and MERS, to observe if the diseases present differently. Our model predicts that influenza initiates with cough, whereas COVID-19 like other coronavirus-related diseases initiates with fever. However, COVID-19 differs from SARS and MERS in the order of gastrointestinal symptoms. Our results support the notion that fever should be used to screen for entry into facilities as regions begin to reopen after the outbreak of Spring 2020. Additionally, our findings suggest that good clinical practice should involve recording the order of symptom occurrence in COVID-19 and other diseases. If such a systemic clinical practice had been standard since ancient diseases, perhaps the transition from local outbreak to pandemic could have been avoided."

In contrast to an acute cold, it appears from several questionnaire-based studies that in the context of COVID-19 infection, anosmia is the main rhinological symptom and is usually not associated with other rhinological symptoms such as rhinorrhoea or nasal obstruction. Until now, no study has directly compared smell and taste function between COVID-19 patients and patients with other causes of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) using valid and reliable psychophysical tests. In this study, we aimed to objectively assess and compare olfactory and gustatory functions in 10 COVID-19 patients (PCR diagnosed, assessed on average 2 weeks after infection), 10 acute cold (AC) patients (assessed before the COVID-19 outbreak) and 10 healthy controls, matched for age and sex. Smell performance was assessed using the extended \"Sniffin' Sticks\" test battery (4), while taste function was assessed using \"taste strips\" (5). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were built to probe olfactory and gustatory scores in terms of their discrimination between COVID-19 and AC patients. Our results suggest that mechanisms of COVID-19 related olfactory dysfunction are different from those seen in an AC and may reflect, at least to some extent, a specific involvement at the level of central nervous system in some COVID-19 patients. In the future, studies to assess the prevalence of persistent anosmia and neuroanatomical changes on MRI correlated to chemosensory function, will be useful to understand these mechanisms."

A novel coronavirus, leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome, also called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), seems to be a new member of neuroinvasive viruses. While severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) keeps on spreading around the world rapidly, reports about the neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2, increases day by day. It is reported that a variety of symptoms and syndromes such as headache, dizziness, confusion, ataxia, epilepsy, ischemic stroke, neuropathic pain and myopathy are common especially in more severe COVID-19 patients. It is also suggested that the development of neurological complications is strongly associated with a poor outcome. On the other hand, hyposmia can be the unique symptom in COVID-19 carriers and this can serve as a marker for identifying the otherwise asymptomatically infected patients. It is thought that SARS-CoV-2 may cause neurological symptoms through direct or indirect mechanisms. Nevertheless, neuroinvasion capability of SARS-CoV2 is confirmed by the presence of the virus, in the cerebrospinal fluid of a COVID-19 patient with encephalitis, and this is proven by gene sequencing. In conclusion, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to be aware of the possible neurological complications of the disease. Therefore, in this review, we aimed to report neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 and possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Due to the high homology of SARS-CoV-2 with other human coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, reviewing the neurological involvement also associated with these coronaviruses will provide an idea about the long-term complications of COVID-19."

Pregnant women and patients taking anti-cancer drugs had been excluded from the study. Data from each institution\u2019s electronic medical record had been obtained. Results Sixty patients who had RT-PCR positive for COVID-19 were included in this study; of these patients, all of them had unknown exposure to COVID-19. The mean (SD) age was 45.7 (13.5) years, and 42 were men (70%). Of these patients, 80% had at least ageusia or anosmia. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were cough (75%), fever (71.3%), myalgia or fatigue (53.3%), anosmia (loss of smell) (40%), ageusia (loss of taste) (28.3%), sore throat (25%), shortness of breath (16.7%), headache (16.7%), and GI symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and loss appetite) (16.7%). A total of 68.3% of COVID-19 infected patients had reported either loss of taste or smell, and about 33.3% of them had only loss of smell, while 23.3% of them had impaired taste, and 11.7% of COVID-19 infected patients had both taste and smell loss.

Daily symptom surveys were distributed online and included fever, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, anosmia and Ageusia. A total of 1,003,298 surveys were filled out to date. We used a single measure of symptoms, Symptoms Ratio (SR), defined as a weighted mean of symptoms found to be prevalent in COVID-19 patients. Notably, following severe lockdown measures, we found that between March 15 and April 22, the mean SR sharply declined by 78.9%, as did every individual symptom, including our most common symptoms of cough and rhinorrhea or nasal congestion, which decreased from 14.5% and 13.8% of the survey responders, respectively, to 2.4% and 2.5%. We also observed reduction in symptoms separately in the vast majority of cities in Israel. Overall, these results demonstrate a profound decrease in a variety of clinical symptoms following the implementation of a lockdown in Israel. As our survey symptoms are not specific to COVID-19 infection, this effect likely represents an overall nationwide reduction in the prevalence of infectious diseases, including COVID-19. This quantification may be of major interest for COVID-19 pandemic, as many countries consider implementation of lockdown strategies."

However, less is known about the cardiac involvement as a complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\n\n\nObjective\nTo describe the presentation of acute myocardial inflammation in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who recovered from the influenzalike syndrome and developed fatigue and signs and symptoms of heart failure a week after upper respiratory tract symptoms.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participant\nThis case report describes an otherwise healthy 53-year-old woman who tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to the cardiac care unit in March 2020 for acute myopericarditis with systolic dysfunction, confirmed on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, the week after onset of fever and dry cough due to COVID-19. The patient did not show any respiratory involvement during the clinical course.\n\n\nExposure\nCardiac involvement with COVID-19.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nDetection of cardiac involvement with an increase in levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity troponin T, echocardiography changes, and diffuse biventricular myocardial edema and late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n\nResults\nAn otherwise healthy 53-year-old white woman presented to the emergency department with severe fatigue. She described fever and dry cough the week before. She was afebrile but hypotensive; electrocardiography showed diffuse ST elevation, and elevated high-sensitivity troponin T and NT-proBNP levels were detected. Findings on chest radiography were normal. There was no evidence of obstructive coronary disease on coronary angiography. Based on the COVID-19 outbreak, a nasopharyngeal swab was performed, with a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed increased wall thickness with diffuse biventricular hypokinesis, especially in the apical segments, and severe left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%). Short tau inversion recovery and T2-mapping sequences showed marked biventricular myocardial interstitial edema, and there was also diffuse late gadolinium enhancement involving the entire biventricular wall. There was a circumferential pericardial effusion that was most notable around the right cardiac chambers. These findings were all consistent with acute myopericarditis. She was treated with dobutamine, antiviral drugs (lopinavir/ritonavir), steroids, chloroquine, and medical treatment for heart failure, with progressive clinical and instrumental stabilization.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nThis case highlights cardiac involvement as a complication associated with COVID-19, even without symptoms and signs of interstitial pneumonia."

        "context": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic gripped the world unexpectedly and little was known about the virus or its effects on various cohorts of patients. In the first wave, rheumatology patients on immunosuppressive agents were asked to shield or self-isolate because they were deemed highly clinically vulnerable. As evidence emerged, it became apparent that most of our patients were not adversely affected with their disease management and so it gradually returned to normal.1 Nevertheless, in light of the second wave much uncertainty remains. In this regard, the COVID-19 vaccine is eagerly anticipated to be one of the solutions to the pandemic. Emergence of several potential vaccines has been the topic of discussion in recent weeks. In this Editorial we explore the emerging vaccines and the perception, anxieties, and concerns around them from a rheumatology perspective. COVID-19 vaccines are being developed by various pharmaceutical companies but there are three that seem to be the most promising. Pfizer/BioNTechs COVID-19 vaccine is an RNA vaccine, which is reported to be 95% effective against COVID-19 and is currently in phase 3 of its trials with over 43 000 participants; 41% of global and 45% of US participants are between 56 and 85 years, and 42% of the overall study population have a diverse ethnic background including Asian, Black, Hispanic, and Native American. Most participants have received a second dose as part of a two-dose regimen, but the details of this regimen have not been released.2 Moderna, has also developed an RNA-based vaccine, which is up to 94.5% effective when given over two doses on days 1 and 29.3 The clinical trial cohort includes over 30 000 participants including 7000 over 65 years of age and 5000 participants under 65 years of age with high-risk chronic diseases. AstraZeneca has produced a slightly different COVID-19 vaccine consisting of a viral vector, which is 90% effective when using one of its vaccination regimens consisting of giving a half dose initially then a full dose 1 month later. The trial population is slightly smaller than the others with over 23 000 participants and it is being conducted in the UK, Brazil and South Africa. The cohort consists of participants who are healthy and have medically stable chronic diseases.4 At the time of writing this editorial (November 2020), the results of the phase 3 trials of these three vaccines are yet to be published and peer-reviewed, therefore available data so far are limited to press-releases. Efficacy and safety of these emerging vaccines in the rheumatology population are unknown. It is unclear in the trials which chronic disease patient groups were included or if they were on immunosuppressive therapy. Published phase 1/2 trial data included healthy patients between the ages of 18 and 55 years, patient demographics for phase 3 trials have not been released. However, as none of these vaccines are live attenuated it is assumed that they are safe to be taken by patients on immunosuppressive treatment. The main resistance we envisage with some of the rheumatology patients in taking the vaccine is likely to be their perception rather than scientific reasoning. The RNA vaccine is the first of its kind and understandably we are all apprehensive, as little is known about the long-term side effects of this novel vaccine. So far, none of the three pharmaceutical companies has reported any serious short-term adverse effects. The most common side effects have been fatigue and headache, similar to the influenza vaccine.2,3 The relationship between vaccination uptake and perception is complex. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) controversy in 1998 demonstrates how MMR vaccine uptake fell in subsequent years and the efforts of health authorities to rebuild public trust. Knowledge is power, and educating parents on the correct information was key after the MMR controversy. Milward describes certain features that affect public perception of health messages, which include the relevance of information to everyday life, its relation to other perceived risks, and the extent to which the source of information is trusted.5 Information sourced from informal sources on the internet, social media, and print media will have a potential negative impact. Rheumatology patients are eager to have more information regarding the COVID-19 vaccine so that they can make an informed decision about their long-term disease management. Reflecting on times when vaccines have been introduced or publicized, we can appreciate how the distribution of data regarding their safety and use is imperative to enable rational patient decisions. There are other factors that influence patients\u2019 health decisions on a personal level, which include cultural norms, and religious, educational, and philosophical views, which can all influence attitudes to vaccinations.6 Many patients also rely on the advice and opinion of their healthcare professional and so disseminating accurate information is vital. The concept of vaccination is based on herd immunity where most people in a population have immunity against an infection either directly by previous infection or indirectly via a vaccine to reduce the risk of transmission to those who lack immunity.7 The proportion of people that need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity depends on the infection, for example for measles it is 95%, for polio it is 80%.8 Nevertheless, it is usually most of the population that needs to be vaccinated to protect those who cannot be"

Participants were 387,109 men and women (56.4 \u00b18.8 yr; 55.1% women) residing in England from UK Biobank study. Physical activity, smoking, and alcohol intake, were assessed by questionnaire at baseline (2006-2010). Body mass index, from measured height and weight, was used as an indicator of overall obesity. Outcome was cases of COVID-19 serious enough to warrant a hospital admission from 16-March-2020 to 26-April-2020. There were 760 COVID-19 cases. After adjustment for age, sex and mutually for each lifestyle factor, physical inactivity (Relative risk, 1.32, 95% confidence interval, 1.10, 1.58), smoking (1.42;1.12, 1.79) and obesity (2.05 ;1.68, 2.49) but not heavy alcohol consumption (1.12; 0.93, 1.35) were all related to COVID-19. We also found a dose-dependent increase in risk of COVID-19 with less favourable lifestyle scores, such that participants in the most adverse category had 4-fold higher risk (4.41; 2.52 \u20137.71) compared to people with the most optimal lifestyle. C-reactive protein levels were associated with elevated risk of COVID-19 in a dose-dependent manner, and partly (10 \u2013 16%) explained associations between adverse lifestyle and COVID-19. Based on UK risk factor prevalence estimates, unhealthy behaviours in combination accounted for up to 51% of the population attributable fraction of severe COVID-19. Our findings suggest that an unhealthy lifestyle synonymous with an elevated risk of non-communicable disease is also a risk factor for COVID-19 hospital admission, which might be partly explained by low grade inflammation. Adopting simple lifestyle changes could lower the risk of severe infection.\n \n"

        "context": "Abstract Background With evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic. Data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and critical), based on initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify risk factors associated with clinical outcomes, and log-rank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression. Results Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement in patient outcomes. By univariate logistic regression analysis, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Multivariate regression indicated age over 65 years (p<0.001), smoking (p=0.001), critical disease status (p=0.002), diabetes (p=0.025), high hypersensitive troponin I (>0.04 pg/mL, p=0.02), leukocytosis (>10 x 109/L, p<0.001) and neutrophilia (>75 x 109/L, p<0.001) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes. By contrast, the administration of hypnotics was significantly associated with favorable outcomes (p<0.001), which was confirmed by survival analysis. Conclusions Hypnotics may be an effective ancillary treatment for COVID-19. We also found novel risk factors, such as higher hypersensitive troponin I, predicted poor clinical outcomes. Overall, our study provides useful data to guide early clinical decision making to reduce mortality and improve clinical outcomes of COVID-19."

        "context": "Background With evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic. As such, data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective chart review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and critical), based on their initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify factors associated with clinical outcomes, and logrank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression. Results Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement on patient outcomes in the study. By univariate logistic regression model, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Further, multivariate regression indicated that age over 65 years, smoking, critical disease status, diabetes, high hypersensitive troponin I (>0.04 pg/mL), leukocytosis (>10 x 109/L) and neutrophilia (>75 x 109/L) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes. By contrast, the use of hypnotics was significantly associated with favorable outcomes. Survival analysis also confirmed that patients receiving hypnotics had significantly better survival. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first indication that hypnotics could be an effective ancillary treatment for COVID-19. We also found that novel risk factors, such as higher hypersensitive troponin I, predicted poor clinical outcomes.

        "context": "Objective Previous studies that evaluated cardiovascular risk factors considered age as a potential confounder. We aimed to investigate the impact of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors on fatal outcomes according to age in patients with COVID-19. Methods A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was performed on data collected from PubMed and Embase databases up to 11 June 2020. All observational studies (case series or cohort studies) that assessed in-hospital patients were included, except those involving the paediatric population. Prevalence rates of comorbid diseases and clinical outcomes were stratified by mean patient age in each study (ranges: <50 years, 50\u201360 years and \u226560 years). The primary outcome measure was a composite fatal outcome of severe COVID-19 or death. Results We included 51 studies with a total of 48\u2009317 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Overall, the relative risk of developing severe COVID-19 or death was significantly higher in patients with risk factors for CVD (hypertension: OR 2.50, 95% CI 2.15 to 2.90; diabetes: 2.25, 95% CI 1.89 to 2.69) and CVD (3.11, 95% 2.55 to 3.79). Younger patients had a lower prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and CVD compared with older patients; however, the relative risk of fatal outcomes was higher among the former. Conclusions The results of the meta-analysis suggest that CVD and its risk factors (hypertension and diabetes) were closely related to fatal outcomes in COVID-19 for patients across all ages. Although young patients had lower prevalence rates of cardiovascular comorbidities than elderly patients, relative risk of fatal outcome in young patients with hypertension, diabetes and CVD was higher than in elderly patients.

        "context": "At this time of the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially effective treatments are currently under urgent investigation. Benefits of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 infection have been proposed and clinical trials are underway. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, typically used for the treatment of malaria and autoimmune diseases, have been considered for off-label use in several countries. In the literature, there are reports of ototoxic effects of the drugs causing damage to the inner ear structures, which then result in hearing loss, tinnitus, and/or imbalance. This mini-review represents a summary of the findings from a systematic search regarding ototoxicity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the published literature. The characteristics of sensorineural hearing loss and/or tinnitus after chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine treatment can be temporary but reports of persistent auditory and vestibular dysfunction exist. These are not frequent, but the impact can be substantial. Additionally, abnormal cochleovestibular development in the newborn was also reported after chloroquine treatment in pregnant women. The suggested dose of chloroquine for COVID-19 infection is considerably higher than the usual dosage for malaria treatment; therefore, it is plausible that the ototoxic effects will be greater. There are potential implications from this review for survivors of COVID-19 treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Patient reports of hearing loss, tinnitus, or imbalance should be noted. Those with troublesome hearing loss, tinnitus and/or imbalance are encouraged to be referred for hearing evaluation and interventions once they are stable. Clinical trials of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine should also consider including audiological monitoring in the protocol."

All consecutive inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nClinical laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of patients with and without cardiac injury were compared. The association between cardiac injury and mortality was analyzed.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 416 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included in the final analysis; the median age was 64 years (range, 21-95 years), and 211 (50.7%) were female. Common symptoms included fever (334 patients [80.3%]), cough (144 [34.6%]), and shortness of breath (117 [28.1%]).

Some data point to an increased risk of respiratory infections in patients being treated with antagonists of interleukin (IL)-17 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) [1, 2]. On the other hand, these same drugs have been used to treat the sometimes deadly \u2018cytokine storm\u2019 of COVID-19 [3, 4]. In this study, we evaluated the incidence of COVID-19 in a population of patients with plaque psoriasis receiving biologic therapies compared with the general population. All patients were observed at the out-patient clinics of three Dermatology Units uniformly covering the Veneto region in Italy, namely Verona, Padua and Vicenza. General statistics and data on comorbidities in the underlying regional population were retrieved from ISTAT census data [8] and the Italian Observatory on Healthcare Report 2018 [9]. Data on COVID-19 confirmed cases, including demographics, hospitalizations and deaths, were extracted from the Regional Health Agency [10] as well as from the National Health Institute (ISS) [11]. From February 20 to June 1, 2020, a total of 1830 patients were included in the main analysis, with a total of 6199.5 patient-months of follow-up. The characteristics of the studied population are outlined in Table 1. Most of them (55.3%) were treated with TNF inhibitors. Over the period analyzed, all patients were recommended not to modify their treatment regimen. The COVID-19 incidence rate (IR) was 9.7 (95% CI 3.9\u201320.1) per 10,000 person-months in our cohort and 11.5 (95% CI 11.4\u201311.7) per 10,000 person-months in the general regional population, resulting in an incidence rate difference (IRD) of \u2212 1.8 (95% CI \u2212 7.6 to 8.6). The IR of hospitalization for COVID-19-related pneumonia and COVID-19-related death were 6.5 (95% CI 2.0\u201315.6) and 0 (95% CI 0\u201310.4) per 10,000 person-months in our cohort and 9.6 (95% CI 9.4\u20139.7) and 1.16 (95% CI 1.10\u20131.21) per 10,000 person-months in the general population, resulting in an IRD of \u2212 3.1 (95% CI \u2212 7.5 to 6.0) and \u2212 1.2 (95% CI \u2212 2.6 to 3.7), respectively. There were only six cases of COVID-19 among 1830 psoriatic patients compared with 19,154 cases among 4,905,854 individuals (16,601,409.94 person-months) from the general population. Out of the six cases of COVID-19, four were admitted to hospital because of interstitial pneumonia. None of them died. The patients were treated with etanercept, ustekinumab, ixekizumab, secukinumab, and guselkumab. In our large cohort of psoriatic patients, no signal emerged for an increased risk of COVID-19 or COVID19-related respiratory or life-threatening complications associated with biologics. Our analysis was flawed by low numbers of patients with COVID-19 in our cohort. Nonetheless, our cohort of psoriatic patients had a higher prevalence of comorbidities compared with the general population, including hypertension (25.9% vs 17%), diabetes mellitus (13.8% vs 4.5%), and cardiovascular diseases (12.2 vs 4.3%). All of these conditions have been associated with a significantly increased rate of hospitalization and fatal course in COVID-19 patients [5]. Therefore, a higher incidence of COVID-19-related hospitalization and death would have been expected in our psoriasis patients.

Methods We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir\u2013ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. Results A total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group. Treatment with lopinavir\u2013ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72). Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, \u22125.8 percentage points; 95% CI, \u221217.3 to 5.7). The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group. Lopinavir\u2013ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events. Conclusions In hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir\u2013ritonavir treatment beyond standard care. Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.

Additionally, some patients with COVID\u201019 also showed neurologic signs, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting. Increasing evidence shows that coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases. The infection of SARS\u2010CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected. Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse\u2010connected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways.

In addition to the conserved architecture of the polymerase core of the viral polymerase family, nsp12 possesses a newly identified \u03b2-hairpin domain at its N terminus. A comparative analysis model shows how remdesivir binds to this polymerase. The structure provides a basis for the design of new antiviral therapeutics that target viral RdRp."

        "context": "\n Summary\n \n Background\n To date, few data on paediatric COVID-19 have been published, and most reports originate from China. This study aimed to capture key data on children and adolescents with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection across Europe to inform physicians and health-care service planning during the ongoing pandemic.\n \n \n Methods\n This multicentre cohort study involved 82 participating health-care institutions across 25 European countries, using a well established research network\u2014the Paediatric Tuberculosis Network European Trials Group (ptbnet)\u2014that mainly comprises paediatric infectious diseases specialists and paediatric pulmonologists. We included all individuals aged 18 years or younger with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, detected at any anatomical site by RT-PCR, between April 1 and April 24, 2020, during the initial peak of the European COVID-19 pandemic. We explored factors associated with need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and initiation of drug treatment for COVID-19 using univariable analysis, and applied multivariable logistic regression with backwards stepwise analysis to further explore those factors significantly associated with ICU admission.\n \n \n Findings\n 582 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included, with a median age of 5\u00b70 years (IQR 0\u00b75\u201312\u00b70) and a sex ratio of 1\u00b715 males per female. 145 (25%) had pre-existing medical conditions. 363 (62%) individuals were admitted to hospital. 48 (8%) individuals required ICU admission, 25 (4%) mechanical ventilation (median duration 7 days, IQR 2\u201311, range 1\u201334), 19 (3%) inotropic support, and one (<1%) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Significant risk factors for requiring ICU admission in multivariable analyses were being younger than 1 month (odds ratio 5\u00b706, 95% CI 1\u00b772\u201314\u00b787; p=0\u00b70035), male sex (2\u00b712, 1\u00b706\u20134\u00b721; p=0\u00b7033), pre-existing medical conditions (3\u00b727, 1\u00b767\u20136\u00b742; p=0\u00b70015), and presence of lower respiratory tract infection signs or symptoms at presentation (10\u00b746, 5\u00b716\u201321\u00b723; p<0\u00b70001). The most frequently used drug with antiviral activity was hydroxychloroquine (40 [7%] patients), followed by remdesivir (17 [3%] patients), lopinavir\u2013ritonavir (six [1%] patients), and oseltamivir (three [1%] patients). Immunomodulatory medication used included corticosteroids (22 [4%] patients), intravenous immunoglobulin (seven [1%] patients), tocilizumab (four [1%] patients), anakinra (three [1%] patients), and siltuximab (one [<1%] patient). Four children died (case-fatality rate 0\u00b769%, 95% CI 0\u00b720\u20131\u00b782); at study end, the remaining 578 were alive and only 25 (4%) were still symptomatic or requiring respiratory support.\n \n \n Interpretation\n COVID-19 is generally a mild disease in children, including infants. However, a small proportion develop severe disease requiring ICU admission and prolonged ventilation, although fatal outcome is overall rare. The data also reflect the current uncertainties regarding specific treatment options, highlighting that additional data on antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs are urgently needed.\n \n \n Funding\n ptbnet is supported by Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit.\n \n"

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 and is believed to originate from bat, quickly spread into a global pandemic. This RNA virus has a special affinity for porphyrins. It invades the cell at the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor and binds to hemoproteins, resulting in a severe systemic inflammatory response, particularly in high ACE-2 organs like the lungs, heart, and kidney, resulting in systemic disease. The inflammatory response manifested by increased cytokine levels and reactive oxygen species results in inhibition of heme oxygenase (HO-1), with a subsequent loss of cytoprotection. This has been seen in other viral illness like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, and SARS/MERS. There are a number of medications that have been tried with some showing early clinical promise. This illness disproportionately affects patients with obesity, a chronic inflammatory disease with a baseline excess of cytokines. The majority of the medications used in the treatment of COVID-19 are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, primarily CYP2D6. This is further complicated by genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6, HO-1, ACE, and ACE-2. There is a potential role for HO-1 upregulation to treat/prevent cytokine storm. Current therapy must focus on antivirals and heme oxygenase upregulation. Vaccine development will be the only magic bullet."

Currently, there more than 64 vaccine candidates, most of them aiming to induce neutralizing antibodies against the spike protein (S). These antibodies will prevent uptake through the human ACE-2 receptor, thereby limiting viral entrance. Different vaccine platforms are being used for vaccine development, each one presenting several advantages and disadvantages.

The host range and tissue tropism are largely determined by the coronaviral spike protein, which initiates cellular infection by promoting fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. Companion animal coronaviruses responsible for causing enteric infection include feline enteric coronavirus, ferret enteric coronavirus, canine enteric coronavirus, equine coronavirus, and alpaca enteric coronavirus, while canine respiratory coronavirus and alpaca respiratory coronavirus result in respiratory infection. Ferret systemic coronavirus and feline infectious peritonitis virus, a mutated feline enteric coronavirus, can lead to lethal immuno-inflammatory systemic disease. Recent human viral pandemics, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and most recently, COVID-19, all thought to originate from bat coronaviruses, demonstrate the zoonotic potential of coronaviruses and their potential to have devastating impacts. A better understanding of the coronaviruses of companion animals, their capacity for cross-species transmission, and the sharing of genetic information may facilitate improved prevention and control strategies for future emerging zoonotic coronaviruses.

        "context": "Covid-19 is an exemplary case of a public bad. Although the disease threatens some demographic categories more than others, the pandemic ultimately threatens the entire public. Therefore, knowledge about the causes, consequences, and strategies to mitigate the pandemic is a public good that will benefit us all. Because such public knowledge is unlikely to be profitable, there is little incentive for private firms to invest in the research. It is therefore up to governments to support university research to generate such knowledge. Publicly funded, public-goods agriculture and food research is necessary for understanding and preventing pandemics, like Covid-19, because pandemics often originate in the agriculture and food system. Private goods are things that people must buy, whereas public goods are available to everyone. Potential zoonotic viruses are ubiquitous, but they will not jump from one species to another without the right conditions. The destruction of wildlife habitat and the crowding of different species into marketplaces are two conditions that facilitate species jumping (Bodin 2020). Knowledge about how the agricultural and food system fosters the creation and spread of zoonotic viruses is a public good because all people benefit from knowledge that could protect them from infection. There is evidence that the 2003 SARS virus and the current Covid-19 pandemic passed through intermediary species after originating in bats. SARS moved from bats to people through civets, and Covid-19 through pangolins. Because pangolins are endangered species, they are poached and smuggled into China where their meat and scales are believed to provide health benefits. The butchering of these animals, when people interact with the animal fluids most directly, provides the optimal conditions for a virus that has mutated in just the right way to cross the species barrier (Breiman 2020). Zoonotic diseases like Covid-19 thus reveal distressing dimensions of the global agriculture and food system that are not adequately understood or regulated through private commerce. Since colleges of agriculture at United States land-grant universities have thousands of social and biophysical scientists who study natural resource use and the agriculture and food system, these agricultural colleges are well positioned to explain the complex social and biophysical dynamics that promote the emergence and spread of the diseases, including habitat loss, the exploitation and maltreatment of animals, and inequality, injustice, and dangerous and unhygienic working conditions. All of these issues have public dimensions that leave them outside the purview of food markets in most countries. Unfortunately, public funding for agriculture and food research has stagnated and even declined in the United States and other industrial nations over the past five decades, and agriculture and food research has increasingly been directed at generating private goods. In 1973, nearly 70% of research at all US universities came from the federal government. In 2018, the federal government provided only 53%. Universities themselves funded more than 25% of the research at their own institutions in 2018, compared to less than 10% in 1973. This information signals that universities must generate their own revenues to keep pace with research needs. Universities often do this by expanding endowments, attracting gifts from private firms, and encouraging faculty to privatize their activities by patenting and licensing their research findings (NSF 2020). University patenting activities have increased substantially over the past two decades (Glenna 2017). In the agriculture and food sector, government funding for research and development declined in real dollars between 2005 and 2015, while private investment increased sharply (Clancy et al. 2016). This means that the private sector is likely driving This article is part of the Topical Collection: Agriculture, Food & Covid-19."

There have been around 96,000 reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date (05/03/2020). The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d. The symptoms are usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others. The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction. Many people are asymptomatic. The case fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%. Diagnosis is by demonstration of the virus in respiratory secretions by special molecular tests. Common laboratory findings include normal/ low white cell counts with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease. Treatment is essentially supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established. Prevention entails home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet precautions. The virus spreads faster than its two ancestors the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower fatality.

        "context": "Keeping the lid on infection spread From February to April 2020, many countries introduced variations on social distancing measures to slow the ravages of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Publicly available data show that Germany has been particularly successful in minimizing death rates. Dehning et al. quantified three governmental interventions introduced to control the outbreak. The authors predicted that the third governmental intervention\u2014a strict contact ban since 22 March\u2014switched incidence from growth to decay. They emphasize that relaxation of controls must be done carefully, not only because there is a 2-week lag between a measure being enacted and the effect on case reports but also because the three measures used in Germany only just kept virus spread below the growth threshold. Science, this issue p. eabb9789 Modeling and Bayesian inference reveal the time dependence of SARS-CoV-2 interventions on the number of new infections. INTRODUCTION When faced with the outbreak of a novel epidemic such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), rapid response measures are required by individuals, as well as by society as a whole, to mitigate the spread of the virus. During this initial, time-critical period, neither the central epidemiological parameters nor the effectiveness of interventions such as cancellation of public events, school closings, or social distancing is known. RATIONALE As one of the key epidemiological parameters, we inferred the spreading rate \u03bb from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections using the example of Germany. We apply Bayesian inference based on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to a class of compartmental models [susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)]. Our analysis characterizes the temporal change of the spreading rate and allows us to identify potential change points. Furthermore, it enables short-term forecast scenarios that assume various degrees of social distancing. A detailed description is provided in the accompanying paper, and the models, inference, and forecasts are available on GitHub (https://github.com/Priesemann-Group/covid19_inference_forecast). Although we apply the model to Germany, our approach can be readily adapted to other countries or regions. RESULTS In Germany, interventions to contain the COVID-19 outbreak were implemented in three steps over 3 weeks: (i) Around 9 March 2020, large public events such as soccer matches were canceled; (ii) around 16 March 2020, schools, childcare facilities, and many stores were closed; and (iii) on 23 March 2020, a far-reaching contact ban (Kontaktsperre) was imposed by government authorities; this included the prohibition of even small public gatherings as well as the closing of restaurants and all nonessential stores. From the observed case numbers of COVID-19, we can quantify the impact of these measures on the disease spread using change point analysis. Essentially, we find that at each change point the spreading rate \u03bb decreased by ~40%. At the first change point, assumed around 9 March 2020, \u03bb decreased from 0.43 to 0.25, with 95% credible intervals (CIs) of [0.35, 0.51] and [0.20, 0.30], respectively. At the second change point, assumed around 16 March 2020, \u03bb decreased to 0.15 (CI [0.12, 0.20]). Both changes in \u03bb slowed the spread of the virus but still implied exponential growth (see red and orange traces in the figure). To contain the disease spread, i.e., to turn exponential growth into a decline of new cases, the spreading rate has to be smaller than the recovery rate \u03bc = 0.13 (CI [0.09, 0.18]). This critical transition was reached with the third change point, which resulted in \u03bb = 0.09 (CI [0.06, 0.13]; see blue trace in the figure), assumed around 23 March 2020. From the peak position of daily new cases, one could conclude that the transition from growth to decline was already reached at the end of March. However, the observed transient decline can be explained by a short-term effect that originates from a sudden change in the spreading rate (see Fig. 2C in the main text). As long as interventions and the concurrent individual behavior frequently change the spreading rate, reliable short- and long-term forecasts are very difficult. As the figure shows, the three example scenarios (representing the effects up to the first, second, and third change point) quickly diverge from each other and, consequently, span a considerable range of future case numbers. Inference and subsequent forecasts are further complicated by the delay of ~2 weeks between an intervention and the first useful estimates of the new \u03bb (which are derived from the reported case numbers). Because of this delay, any uncertainty in the magnitude of social distancing in the previous 2 weeks can have a major impact on the case numbers in the subsequent 2 weeks. Beyond 2 weeks, the case numbers depend on our future behavior, for which we must make explicit assumptions. In sum, future interventions (such as lifting restrictions) should be implemented cautiously to respect the delayed visibility of their effects. CONCLUSION We developed a Bayesian framework for the spread of COVID-19 to infer central epidemiological parameters and the timing and magnitude of intervention effects. With such an approach, the effects of interventions can be assessed in a timely manner. Future interventions and lifting of restrictions can be modeled as additional change points, enabling short-term forecasts for case numbers. In general, our approach may help to infer the efficiency of measures taken in other countries and inform policy-makers about tightening, loosening, and selecting appropriate measures for containment of COVID-19. Bayesian inference of SIR model parameters from daily new cases of COVID-19 enables us to assess the impact of interventions. In Germany, three interventions (mild social distancing, strong social distancing, and contact ban) were enacted consecutively (circles). Colored lines depict the inferred models that include the impact of one, two, or three interventions (red, orange, or green, respectively, with individual data cutoff) or all available data until 21 April 2020 (blue). Forecasts (dashed lines) show how case numbers would have developed without the effects of the subsequent change points. Note the delay between intervention and first possible inference of parameters caused by the reporting delay and the necessary accumulation of evidence (gray arrows). Shaded areas indicate 50% and 95% Bayesian credible intervals. As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading across the globe, short-term modeling forecasts provide time-critical information for decisions on containment and mitigation strategies. A major challenge for short-term forecasts is the assessment of key epidemiological parameters and how they change when first interventions show an effect. By combining an established epidemiological model with Bayesian inference, we analyzed the time dependence of the effective growth rate of new infections. Focusing on COVID-19 spread in Germany, we detected change points in the effective growth rate that correlate well with the times of publicly announced interventions. Thereby, we could quantify the effect of interventions and incorporate the corresponding change points into forecasts of future scenarios and case numbers. Our code is freely available and can be readily adapted to any country or region."

Human-to-human transmission occurs mainly through respiratory droplets, but other routes are under investigation, because SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in several body fluids (1). So far, few data are available on ocular samples from patients with COVID-19, although conjunctivitis has been occasionally reported among COVID-19 symptoms, similar to infections caused by other human coronaviruses (2, 3). During the SARS epidemic, eye exposure to infectious fluids was associated with an increased risk for SARS-CoV transmission to health care workers (3, 4). Although SARS-CoV RNA was occasionally found in ocular specimens during the early phase of illness, its infectivity is unknown (2, 3). With regard to COVID-19, unprotected ocular exposure was thought to be responsible for infections that occurred in the Wuhan Fever Clinic in January 2020 (3, 4); in addition, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in conjunctival secretions collected from the only patient with conjunctivitis out of 30 patients with COVID-19 from a hospital in China (5). However, further studies are needed to evaluate the infectious potential of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in the ocular specimens and to determine whether transmission may occur through ocular secretions (3, 4). Objective: To present the early detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in ocular fluids from a patient with the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Italy, who had been hospitalized at the National Institute for Infectious Diseases \u201cL. Spallanzani\u201d (INMI) in Rome. Methods and Findings: The patient, a 65-year-old woman, travelled from Wuhan, China, to Italy on 23 January 2020 and was admitted on 29 January 2020, 1 day after symptom onset. At admission to the high isolation unit at INMI, she presented with nonproductive cough, sore throat, coryza, and bilateral conjunctivitis. She had no fever until day 4, when fever (38 \u00b0C), nausea, and vomiting began. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by performing real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay on sputum samples (cycle threshold value [Ct], 16.1) on the admission day, followed by viral M gene sequencing (GenBank accession number MT008022), and virus isolation on Vero E6 cell line (2019nCoV/Italy-INMI1). The full genome sequence was obtained from either clinical sample and or culture isolate (GISAID accession numbers EPI_ISL_410545 and EPI_ISL_410546). At admission, no other respiratory infections were detected (QIAstat-Dx\u00ae Respiratory Panel; Qiagen). On day 3 after hospital admission, owing to the persistence of conjunctivitis, an ocular swab was collected and viral RNA was detected (Ct, 21.6). Subsequent ocular samples collected with almost daily frequency resulted positive up to day 21, with declining virus concentration (increased Ct values). Conjunctivitis greatly improved at day 15 and apparently resolved at day 20. Five days after it became undetectable, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected again (Ct, 36.25) in the ocular swab sample collected at day 27 (Table). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in ocular swabs days after it was undetectable in nasal swabs (Table). In addition, the Ct values detected in the late ocular samples were lower than those observed in the nasal swabs (Table 1), suggesting sustained replication in conjunctiva. With the aim of demonstrating that viral genomes detected in ocular swabs represented infectious virus, the first RNApositive ocular sample was inoculated in Vero E6 cells, and cytopathic effect was observed 5 days postinoculum. Viral replication was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR on RNA purified from spent cell growth medium. Discussion: We found that ocular fluids from SARS-CoV2-infected patients may contain infectious virus, and hence may be a potential source of infection. These findings highlight the importance of control measures, such as avoiding touching the nose, mouth, and eyes and frequent hand washing. A related implication is the importance of appropriate use of personal protective equipment for ophthalmologists during clinical examination, because ocular mucosa may be not only a site of virus entry but also a source of contagion. Furthermore, we observed that ocular involvement of SARSCoV-2 may occur early in the COVID-19 course, suggesting"

We reported the clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19 in a single center. Methods Clinical data on 82 death cases laboratory-confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospital\u2032s electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. Findings All patients were local residents of Wuhan, and the great proportion of them were diagnosed as severe illness when admitted. Most of the death cases were male (65.9%). More than half of dead patients were older than 60 years (80.5%) and the median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of death cases had comorbidity (76.8%), including hypertension (56.1%), heart disease (20.7%), diabetes (18.3%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer (7.3%). Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death (69.5%), following by sepsis syndrome/MOF (28.0%), cardiac failure (14.6%), hemorrhage (6.1%), and renal failure (3.7%). Furthermore, respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhage, hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100%, 89%, 80.5%, 78.0%, and 31.7% of patients, respectively. On the admission, lymphopenia (89.2%), neutrophilia (74.3%), and thrombocytopenia (24.3%) were usually observed. Most patients had a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of >5 (94.5%), high systemic immune-inflammation index of >500 (89.2%), increased C-reactive protein level (100%), lactate dehydrogenase (93.2%), and D-dimer (97.1%). A high level of IL-6 (>10 pg/ml) was observed in all detected patients. Median time from initial symptom to death was 15 days (IQR 11-20), and a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase (p=0.002), alanine aminotransferase (p=0.037) and time from initial symptom to death were interestingly observed. Conclusion Older males with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe disease, even die from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Respiratory failure is the main cause of COVID-19, but either virus itself or cytokine release storm mediated damage to other organ including cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hemorrhage should be taken seriously as well."

Infection with M. tuberculosis (MTB), the pathogen that causes TB and latently infects ~25% of the global population, may be a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Objective: To determine if latent or active TB increase susceptibility to SARS-COV-19 infection and disease severity, and lead to more rapid development of COVID-19 pneumonia. Design: An observational case-control study of 36 confirmed COVID-19 cases from Shenyang, China, conducted in Feb 2020. Final date of follow-up: Feb 29, 2020. Cases were grouped according to COVID-19 pneumonia severity (mild/moderate, severe/critical), and MTB infection status compared. Comparisons were made with MTB infection data from another case-control study on bacterial/viral pneumonia at Shenyang Chest Hospital. Setting: Multi-center study involving three primary care hospitals in Shenyang, China. Participants: 86 suspected COVID-19 cases from participating primary-care hospitals in Shenyang. All 36 SARS-CoV-2 +ve cases (based on RT-PCR assay) were included. Disease severity was assessed using the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines of the National Health Commission of China (v6). Mean age, 47 years (range: 25-79), gender ratio, 1:1. Exposures: Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Interferon-gamma Release Assays (IGRA) were performed using peripheral blood to determine MTB infection. Main Outcome and Measures: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory data were collected. Comparison of MTB infection status between patients with mild/moderate and severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Results: Mean age of 36 COVID-19 patients: 47 (range: 25-79); M/F: 18/18; Wuhan/Hubei connection: 42%. Mild/moderate cases: 27 (75%); severe/critical: 9 (25%). MTB infection (IGRA+ve): 13 cases (36.11%), including 7 of 9 severe/critical cases. MTB infection rate: higher in COVID-19 (36.11%) than bacterial pneumonia (20%; p=0.0047) and viral pneumonia patients (16.13%; p=0.024). MTB infection more common than other co-morbidities (36.11% vs diabetes: 25%; hypertension: 22.2%; coronary heart disease: 8.33%; COPD: 5.56%). MTB co-infection linked with disease severity (severe/critical 78% vs mild/moderate cases 22%; p=0.0049), and rate of disease progression: infection to development of symptoms (MTB+SARS-CoV-2: 6.5+/-4.2 days vs SARS-COV-2: 8.9+/-5.2 days; p=0.073); from symptom development to diagnosed as severe (MTB+SARS-CoV-2: 3.4+/-2.0 days vs SARS-COV-2: 7.5+/-0.5 days; p=0.075). Conclusions and Relevance: MTB infection likely increases susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, and increases COVID-19 severity, but this requires validation in a larger study. MTB infection status of COVID-19 patients should be checked routinely at hospital admission."

COVID-19 originated in China and spread world-wide, resulting in the pandemic of 2020. For some reason, COVID-19 shows a considerably higher mortality rate in patients with advanced chronological age. This begs the question as to whether there is a functional association between COVID-19 infection and the process of chronological aging. Two host receptors have been proposed for COVID-19. One is CD26 and the other is ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). Interestingly, both CD26 and the angiotensin system show associations with senescence. Similarly, two proposed therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 infection are Azithromycin and Quercetin, both drugs with significant senolytic activity. Also, Chloroquine-related compounds inhibit the induction of the well-known senescence marker, Beta-galactosidase. Other anti-aging drugs should also be considered, such as Rapamycin and Doxycycline, as they behave as inhibitors of protein synthesis, blocking both SASP and viral replication. Therefore, we wish to speculate that the fight against COVID-19 disease should involve testing the hypothesis that senolytics and other anti-aging drugs may have a prominent role in preventing the transmission of the virus, as well as aid in its treatment. Thus, we propose that new clinical trials may be warranted, as several senolytic and anti-aging therapeutics are existing FDA-approved drugs, with excellent safety profiles, and would be readily available for drug repurposing efforts. As Azithromycin and Doxycycline are both commonly used antibiotics that inhibit viral replication and IL-6 production, we may want to consider this general class of antibiotics that functionally inhibits cellular protein synthesis as a side-effect, for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 disease."

The expression of primary target receptor for SARS-CoV-2,\u00a0i.e. angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), decreases with age. ACE-2 has lung protective effects by limiting angiotensin-2 mediated pulmonary capillary leak and inflammation. Severe COVID-19 disease is associated with high and persistent viral loads in adults. Children have strong innate immune response due to trained immunity (secondary to live-vaccines and frequent viral infections), leading to probably early control of infection at the site of entry. Adult patients show suppressed adaptive immunity and dysfunctional over-active innate immune response in severe infections, which is not seen in children. These could be related to immune-senescence in elderly. Excellent regeneration capacity of pediatric alveolar epithelium may be contributing to early recovery from COVID-19. Children, less frequently, have risk factors such as co-morbidities, smoking, and obesity. But young infants and children with pre-existing illnesses could be high risk groups and need careful monitoring. Studies describing immune-pathogenesis in COVID-19 are lacking in children and need urgent attention."

        "context": "COVID-19, also known as SARS-CoV-2, is a new emerging zoonotic corona virus of the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) family. COVID-19 originated in China and spread world-wide, resulting in the pandemic of 2020. For some reason, COVID-19 shows a considerably higher mortality rate in patients with advanced chronological age. This begs the question as to whether there is a functional association between COVID-19 infection and the process of chronological aging. Two host receptors have been proposed for COVID-19. One is CD26 and the other is ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). Interestingly, both CD26 and the angiotensin system show associations with senescence. Similarly, two proposed therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 infection are Azithromycin and Quercetin, both drugs with significant senolytic activity. Also, Chloroquine-related compounds inhibit the induction of the well-known senescence marker, Beta-galactosidase. Other anti-aging drugs should also be considered, such as Rapamycin and Doxycycline, as they behave as inhibitors of protein synthesis, blocking both SASP and viral replication. Therefore, we wish to speculate that the fight against COVID-19 disease should involve testing the hypothesis that senolytics and other anti-aging drugs may have a prominent role in preventing the transmission of the virus, as well as aid in its treatment. Thus, we propose that new clinical trials may be warranted, as several senolytic and anti-aging therapeutics are existing FDA-approved drugs, with excellent safety profiles, and would be readily available for drug repurposing efforts. As Azithromycin and Doxycycline are both commonly used antibiotics that inhibit viral replication and IL-6 production, we may want to consider this general class of antibiotics that functionally inhibits cellular protein synthesis as a side-effect, for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 disease."

This is due to the emergence of the Corona virus outbreak, which originated in Wuhan City of China, and spread throughout the world. Initially the government did not follow the method used by several other countries related to information provided about the corona covid-19 virus, namely by conducting a quick reaction of prevention socialization. The reason is so that the Indonesian people are not worried about issues that are worrying, other than to minimize the existence of Hoax news from a handful of irresponsible people. Finally the covid-19 outbreak also became a concern for the community, because many Indonesians were affected by the transmission of this virus. Therefore, the government took the initiative to take a lockdown policy for 14 days to anticipate the transmission of this corona outbreak. The study uses qualitative research methods with a literary and empirical approach. The data obtained comes from several regulations, such as the Governor of DKI Jakarta and several other regulations and policies, as well as phenomena that occur in the field. The results of the study stated that Indonesia had experienced a condition where the community's concern about Covid-19 was quite large, so that a government policy to lockdown was needed, as an effort to break the chain of the spread of the Corona Covid-19 virus.

In the face of the projected catastrophic consequences, many countries have enacted social distancing measures in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus. Under these conditions, the Web has become an indispensable medium for information acquisition, communication, and entertainment. At the same time, unfortunately, the Web is being exploited for the dissemination of potentially harmful and disturbing content, such as the spread of conspiracy theories and hateful speech towards specific ethnic groups, in particular towards Chinese people since COVID-19 is believed to have originated from China. \nIn this paper, we make a first attempt to study the emergence of Sinophobic behavior on the Web during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We collect two large-scale datasets from Twitter and 4chan's Politically Incorrect board (/pol/) over a time period of approximately five months and analyze them to investigate whether there is a rise or important differences with regard to the dissemination of Sinophobic content. We find that COVID-19 indeed drives the rise of Sinophobia on the Web and that the dissemination of Sinophobic content is a cross-platform phenomenon: it exists on fringe Web communities like \\dspol, and to a lesser extent on mainstream ones like Twitter. Also, using word embeddings over time, we characterize the evolution and emergence of new Sinophobic slurs on both Twitter and /pol/. Finally, we find interesting differences in the context in which words related to Chinese people are used on the Web before and after the COVID-19 outbreak: on Twitter we observe a shift towards blaming China for the situation, while on /pol/ we find a shift towards using more (and new) Sinophobic slurs."

        "context": "Novel coronaviruses (nCoVs) encode ion-channel proteins called viroporins such as protein E, open reading frame 3a (ORF3a) and ORF8a. These viroporins, via mechanisms such as lysosomal disruption and ion-redistribution in the intracellular environment, activate the innate immune signaling receptor NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing 3) inflammasome. This leads to the production of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), causing tissue inflammation during respiratory illness caused by CoV infection. Due to this crucial role in triggering inflammatory response to infection, the NLRP3 inflammasome appears to be a potential drug target in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2. This manuscript highlights the importance of NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of nCoVs, discusses its known inhibitors and draws attention toward evaluation of these and similar known or novel agents for potential beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). The twenty-first century has witnessed the emergence of three novel coronaviruses (nCoVs): The first outbreak was caused by severe and acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that emerged in Southeast China in 2002, followed by the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 (1). The recent pandemic which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 originated atWuhan city in China in late 2019, is causing a respiratory illness named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which is causing morbidity and mortality worldwide (2). CoVs carry a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of about 30 kb and the virion nucleocapsid is surrounded by an envelop which is studded with spike (S), membrane (M), and envelop (E) proteins (3, 4). The spike (S) glycoprotein recognizes and interacts with its target called angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the host cell surface, mediating viral entry during the infection cycle (5). Identifying and exploiting promising therapeutic targets has always been an area of intensive research in the treatment of viral diseases. In this respect, the spike protein of SARS-CoV is also viewed as a drug target due to its role in a crucial checkpoint of viral infection, i.e., viral attachment and entry in to the host cell. Nevertheless, there are also other virus-host interactionmechanisms (see below) that offer attractive targets for potential therapies in the context of infections caused by SARS-CoVs."

The whole world is now a single global community, where any major happening in one part is bound to have repercussions in rest of the world. Chinese government, in order to control the spread of the disease, had to close the major production centers and as China being a manufacturing hub, led to disruption in the global supply chain which affected almost all sectors ranging from pharmaceuticals to automobile. The disruption of pharmaceutical industry in China had impact on other countries, where the prices of lifesaving drugs increased due to shortage of raw materials from China. As the Chinese industries had ceased production, the global prices of raw materials like metals fell all over leading to major slowdown in various metal producing economies. Emulating China, other affected countries also restricted public gatherings and had to shut down schools, large gatherings, sports, and community activities. Most of the countries had their primary infection contracted from people coming from endemic areas and many countries have stopped flight operations and closed borders. People also started avoiding unnecessary travel, leading to large number of flight cancellations causing major losses for the airline companies. There was overall reduction in oil demand, which led to the largest fall in oil prices in the global market since the Gulf war. The rapid fall in oil prices along with the overall reduction in global industrial production caused major fall in the global stock markets with markets falling more than 20% over a short span of time and the risk of a global 2008-like recession is looming large. The longer the virus spreads, the more economic performance will be impacted, raising concerns about the financial sustainability, especially for highly indebted countries.

The disease caused by this virus, termed coronavirus disease 19 or simply COVID-19, has rapidly spread throughout the world at an alarming pace and has been declared a pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020. In this review, an update on the pathophysiology, clinical presentation and the most recent management strategies for COVID-19 has been described. Materials and Methods A search was conducted for literature and various articles/case reports from 1997 to 2020 in PUBMED/MEDLINE for the keywords coronavirus, SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome and mRNA virus. Results and Conclusions COVID-19 has now spread globally with increasing morbidity and mortality among all populations. In the absence of a proper and effective antibody test, the diagnosis is presently based on a reverse-transcription PCR of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples. The clinical spectrum of the disease presents in the form of a mild, moderate or severe illness. Most patients are either asymptomatic carriers who despite being without symptoms have the potential to be infectious to others coming in close contact, or have a mild influenza-like illness which cannot be differentiated from a simple upper respiratory tract infection. Moderate and severe cases require hospitalisation as well as intensive therapy which includes non-invasive as well as invasive ventilation, along with antipyretics, antivirals, antibiotics and steroids. Complicated cases may require treatment by immunomodulatory drugs and plasma exchange therapy. The search for an effective vaccine for COVID-19 is presently in full swing, with pharmaceutical corporations having started human trials in many countries."

        "context": "Dear Editor COVID-19 is a novel disease caused by a member of the coronavirus family that originated in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019. Over the last few months, the infection has spread to several countries worldwide. Coronaviruses are described by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a large family of viruses, which may cause illness in animals or humans (https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/ q-a-coronaviruses). Although COVID-19 infections in humans most often present with mild symptoms, in a variable percentage of cases, it can cause an acute respiratory syndrome, which has led to patient fatalities (Phan 2020, Lu et al. 2020). COVID-19 appears to be a particular risk for patient with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes; https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coron aviruses). Recently, a letter has been published, detailing the potential impact of COVID-19 in Dentistry (SabinoSilva et al. 2020), whilst other articles have set out the routes of transmission, implications and controls required in dental practice (Peng et al. 2020). In addition, various world, national and dental organizations have issued guidance, for example American Dental Association (http://success.ada.org/en/practice-mana gement/patients/~/media/ 32D2D1F13B3D4D919E67CFBC00AF71B0.pdf), British Dental Association (https://bda.org/news-centre/ latest-news-articles/Pages/Wuhan-novel-coronavirusadvice-for-dentists.aspx) and the WHO (https://www. who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). At the present time, the principle challenge is that the population has no innate protection against COVID-19 and a vaccine has not been developed. It is also of note that no specific antiviral therapy has currently proven to be effective against SARS CoV-2 (the virus causing the disease COVID-19). This combination of no vaccine as well as no effective therapeutic countermeasure is potentially leading to an unknown but possibly challenging scenario with millions of people becoming infected globally. This would inevitably have a major impact on daily life, with the potential to drive even the healthcare systems in developed countries to the brink of collapse. Although the exact transmission routes are yet to be determined with certainty, as with influenza and many other viruses affecting the upper and lower respiratory airways, aerosol transmission between humans has been confirmed. The mean incubation period is estimated to be around 5 days (but probably ranges from 1 to 19 days), which allows travel to spread the disease globally (https://www.who.int/ne ws-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Interestingly, only a few paediatric cases have been reported, whilst in contrast, adult and older patients are frequently involved with some requiring hospitalization and even intubation within intensive care units (Rothan & Byrareddy 2020). The clinical and virological evidence to date is not sufficiently robust to exclude the possibility that virus transmission can occur during the incubation period from infected but asymptomatic patients. Symptoms of COVID-19 are very similar to those of human influenza and include a fever, cough, rhinitis, myalgia, conjunctivitis and fatigue. From a European perspective, at least two separate clusters of infection have been identified in Northern Italy. The entire area of Italy is now a \u2018red zone\u2019 with multiple limitations imposed on education, work and transport. However, considering the rapid spread of the virus, additional restrictions on the movement of the population are being considered in an attempt to reduce the number of patients. All the Italian Schools and Universities suspended teaching activity on 24th February, 2020. The rationale for this decision was to minimize the transmission of the virus between persons of different areas in the hope of reducing the spread of the infection. Considering that SARS CoV-2 has been identified in the saliva of infected patients and that screening to determine the presence of the virus in Italy is carried out by sampling nasopharyngeal secretions, all Medical Doctors, Nurses and Dentists exposed to potential contact with this biological material are, at least in theory, exposed to an unknown risk of acquiring the SARS CoV-23 agent.

Additionally, blocking the receptor, ACE2 via the neutralizing antibodies for viral escape that prevents it from entering into the cells provides another therapeutic regimen. In this review article, we have presented the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in comorbid patients and discussed organ failure caused by this virus. Based on the data available from the scientific literature and ongoing clinical trials, we have focused on therapeutic strategies. We hope that we would fill the gaps that puzzled the researchers and clinicians with the best of our knowledge collected for the betterment of the patients for the coming future.\n \n"

It originated in China in the month of December 2019 and quickly started to spread within the country. On 31st December 2019, it was first reported to country office of World Health Organization (WHO) in China. Since then, it has spread to most of the countries around the globe. However, there has been a recent rise in trend in believing that it would go away during summer days, which has not yet been properly investigated. In this paper, relationship of daily number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 with three environmental factors, viz. maximum relative humidity (RH_max), maximum temperature (T_max) and highest wind speed (WS_max), considering the incubation period, have been investigated statistically, for four of the most affected places of China, viz. Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, Wuhan and five of the most affected places of Italy, viz. Bergamo, Cremona, Lodi, Milano. It has been found that the relationship with maximum relative humidity and highest wind is mostly negligible, whereas relationship with maximum temperature is ranging between negligible to moderate."

The spike in research publications following the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, however, has been like no other. The global crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has mobilised scientific efforts in an unprecedented way. In less than five months, more than 12,000 research items have been indexed while the number increasing every day. With the crisis affecting all aspects of life, research on Covid-19 seems to have become a focal point of interest across many academic disciplines. Here, scientometric aspects of the Covid-19 literature are analysed and contrasted with those of the two previous major Coronavirus diseases, i.e. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The focus is on the co-occurrence of key-terms, bibliographic coupling and citation relations of journals and collaborations between countries. Certain recurring patterns across all three literatures were discovered. All three outbreaks have commonly generated three distinct and major cohort of studies: (i) studies linked to the public health response and epidemic control, (ii) studies associated with the chemical constitution of the virus and (iii) studies related to treatment, vaccine and clinical care. While studies affiliated with the category (i) seem to have been the first to emerge, they overall received least numbers of citations compared to those of the two other categories. Covid-19 studies seem to have been distributed across a broader variety of journals and subject areas. Clear links are observed between the geographical origins of each outbreak or the local geographical severity of each outbreak and the magnitude of research originated from regions. Covid-19 studies also display the involvement of authors from a broader variety of countries compared to SARS and MRS."

We developed data-driven susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine-recovered (SEIQR) models to simulate the epidemic with the interventions of social distancing and epicenter lockdown. Population migration data combined with officially reported data were used to estimate model parameters, and then calculated the daily exported infected individuals by estimating the daily infected ratio and daily susceptible population size. As of Jan 01, 2020, the estimated initial number of latently infected individuals was 380.1 (95%-CI: 379.8~381.0). With 30 days of substantial social distancing, the reproductive number in Wuhan and Hubei was reduced from 2.2 (95%-CI: 1.4~3.9) to 1.58 (95%-CI: 1.34~2.07), and in other provinces from 2.56 (95%-CI: 2.43~2.63) to 1.65 (95%-CI: 1.56~1.76). We found that earlier intervention of social distancing could significantly limit the epidemic in mainland China. The number of infections could be reduced up to 98.9%, and the number of deaths could be reduced by up to 99.3% as of Feb 23, 2020. However, earlier epicenter lockdown would partially neutralize this favorable effect. Because it would cause in situ deteriorating, which overwhelms the improvement out of the epicenter. To minimize the epidemic size and death, stepwise implementation of social distancing in the epicenter city first, then in the province, and later the whole nation without the epicenter lockdown would be practical and cost-effective."

During the interval between 19 February and 23 February 2020, Iran reported its first 43 cases, with 8 deaths. Three exported cases originating in Iran were identified, suggesting an underlying burden of disease in that country greater than that indicated by reported cases. A large epidemic in Iran could further fuel global dissemination of COVID-19. Objective: To quantify the COVID-19 outbreak size in Iran on the basis of known exported case counts and air travel links between Iran and other countries, and to anticipate where infections originating in Iran may spread next. Methods: We assessed interconnectivity between Iran and other countries by using direct and total traveler volumes and final destination cities of travelers originating in Iran in February 2019, according to data from the International Air Transport Association (accounting for 90% of global air travel, with the other 10% modeled by using market intelligence). Because exported cases were identified in United Arab Emirates (UAE), Lebanon, and Canada, we used the methods of Fraser and colleagues (3) to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic in Iran that would be needed for these cases to be observed with a reasonable probability. To estimate the time at risk for COVID-19 exposure among travelers departing Iran, we obtained data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization for the proportion of international travelers who are residents of Iran (4) and the average length of stay of tourists to Iran (5), and assumed that the Iranian outbreak began in early January 2020. We evaluated the relationship between the strength of travel links with Iran and the ranking of destination countries on the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI), a validated metric that estimates the capacity of a country to respond to an infectious disease outbreak. Scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores reflecting greater capacity to manage infectious outbreaks. Findings: A total of 212 000 persons traveled from Iranian airports (Tehran, Rasht, and Arak) to international destinations in February 2019. Although Qom has reported COVID-19 cases, its international airport is still under construction. Global cities receiving the greatest number of total travelers from Iran during this period include Istanbul, Turkey (n = 46 550); Najaf, Iraq (n = 24 659); and Dubai, UAE (n = 16 340). Among the top 10 traveler-receiving cities, 4 (Najaf, Baghdad, Damascus, and Baku) are in countries with an IDVI score lower than 0.6, suggesting elevated vulnerability to infectious disease outbreaks as well as limited ability to detect cases (Figure 1). United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, and Canada ranked third, 21st, and 31st, respectively, for outbound air travel volume from Iran in February 2019. We estimated that 18 300 COVID-19 cases (95% CI, 3770 to 53 470 cases) would have had to occur in Iran, assuming an outbreak duration of 1.5 months in the country, in order to observe these 3 internationally exported cases reported at the time of writing."

Originating from China, cases quickly spread across the globe, prompting the implementation of stringent measures by world governments in efforts to isolate cases and limit the transmission rate of the virus. These measures have however shattered the core sustaining pillars of the modern world economies as global trade and cooperation succumbed to nationalist focus and competition for scarce supplies. Against this backdrop, this paper presents a critical review of the catalogue of negative and positive impacts of the pandemic and proffers perspectives on how it can be leveraged to steer towards a better, more resilient low-carbon economy. The paper diagnosed the danger of relying on pandemic-driven benefits to achieving sustainable development goals and emphasizes a need for a decisive, fundamental structural change to the dynamics of how we live. It argues for a rethink of the present global economic growth model, shaped by a linear economy system and sustained by profiteering and energy-gulping manufacturing processes, in favour of a more sustainable model recalibrated on circular economy (CE) framework. Building on evidence in support of CE as a vehicle for balancing the complex equation of accomplishing profit with minimal environmental harms, the paper outlines concrete sector-specific recommendations on CE-related solutions as a catalyst for the global economic growth and development in a resilient post-COVID-19 world.\n"

Tests for COVID-19 include molecular tests and serological tests. Nucleic acid testing is a gold standard, while serological tests are used in seroprevalence. The tests should be selected according to the time course of the virus and serological response. The targeted genes are several. In our country, real-time polymerase chain reaction kit targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene fragment is being used. Common sample types are nasopharynx and/or oropharynx swabs. Patients with pneumonia sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, etc., should be tested. The peak concentrations of viral load reach before day 5, and the virus can be detected until the end of the 1st week after the onset of illness from nasal-pharynx. There are also rapid tests either detect the viral components in nasopharyngeal secretions or antibodies. IgM/IgA and IgG antibody are detectable on day 5 and day 14, respectively, after symptom onset. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits based on recombinant nucleocapsid protein and spike protein are expected to give more reliable results. Rapid diagnostic tests detecting neither antigen nor antibody is the first choice of the World Health Organization for diagnosis but is recommended to be used for surveillance. Ideal guidance in current circumstances is to confirm cases with available tests by following national recommendations so that we should take action as soon as possible, give appropriate therapy, and determine their contacts for infection prevention."

Objectives To assess the diagnostic accuracy of point\u2010of\u2010care antigen and molecular\u2010based tests to determine if a person presenting in the community or in primary or secondary care has current SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Search methods On 25 May 2020 we undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID\u201019 Study Register and the COVID\u201019 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID\u201019 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions. Selection criteria We included studies of people with suspected current SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, known to have, or not to have SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection. We included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated antigen or molecular tests suitable for a point\u2010of\u2010care setting (minimal equipment, sample preparation, and biosafety requirements, with results available within two hours of sample collection). We included all reference standards to define the presence or absence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) tests and established clinical diagnostic criteria). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened studies and resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. One review author independently extracted study characteristics, which were checked by a second review author. Two review authors independently extracted 2x2 contingency table data and assessed risk of bias and applicability of the studies using the QUADAS\u20102 tool. We present sensitivity and specificity, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), for each test using paired forest plots. We pooled data using the bivariate hierarchical model separately for antigen and molecular\u2010based tests, with simplifications when few studies were available. We tabulated available data by test manufacturer. Main results We included 22 publications reporting on a total of 18 study cohorts with 3198 unique samples, of which 1775 had confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.

We identified data for eight commercial tests (four antigen and four molecular) and one in\u2010house antigen test. Five of the studies included were only available as preprints. We did not find any studies at low risk of bias for all quality domains and had concerns about applicability of results across all studies. We judged patient selection to be at high risk of bias in 50% of the studies because of deliberate over\u2010sampling of samples with confirmed COVID\u201019 infection and unclear in seven out of 18 studies because of poor reporting. Sixteen (89%) studies used only a single, negative RT\u2010PCR to confirm the absence of COVID\u201019 infection, risking missing infection. There was a lack of information on blinding of index test (n = 11), and around participant exclusions from analyses (n = 10). We did not observe differences in methodological quality between antigen and molecular test evaluations. Antigen tests Sensitivity varied considerably across studies (from 0% to 94%): the average sensitivity was 56.2% (95% CI 29.5 to 79.8%) and average specificity was 99.5% (95% CI 98.1% to 99.9%; based on 8 evaluations in 5 studies on 943 samples). Data for individual antigen tests were limited with no more than two studies for any test. Rapid molecular assays Sensitivity showed less variation compared to antigen tests (from 68% to 100%), average sensitivity was 95.2% (95% CI 86.7% to 98.3%) and specificity 98.9% (95% CI 97.3% to 99.5%) based on 13 evaluations in 11 studies of on 2255 samples. Predicted values based on a hypothetical cohort of 1000 people with suspected COVID\u201019 infection (with a prevalence of 10%) result in 105 positive test results including 10 false positives (positive predictive value 90%), and 895 negative results including 5 false negatives (negative predictive value 99%). Individual tests We calculated pooled results of individual tests for ID NOW (Abbott Laboratories) (5 evaluations) and Xpert Xpress (Cepheid Inc) (6 evaluations). Summary sensitivity for the Xpert Xpress assay (99.4%, 95% CI 98.0% to 99.8%) was 22.6 (95% CI 18.8 to 26.3) percentage points higher than that of ID NOW (76.8%, (95% CI 72.9% to 80.3%), whilst the specificity of Xpert Xpress (96.8%, 95% CI 90.6% to 99.0%) was marginally lower than ID NOW (99.6%, 95% CI 98.4% to 99.9%; a difference of \u22122.8% (95% CI \u22126.4 to 0.8)) Authors' conclusions This review identifies early\u2010stage evaluations of point\u2010of\u2010care tests for detecting SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, largely based on remnant laboratory samples. The findings currently have limited applicability, as we are uncertain whether tests will perform in the same way in clinical practice, and according to symptoms of COVID\u201019, duration of symptoms, or in asymptomatic people. Rapid tests have the potential to be used to inform triage of RT\u2010PCR use, allowing earlier detection of those testing positive, but the evidence currently is not strong enough to determine how useful they are in clinical practice. Prospective and comparative evaluations of rapid tests for COVID\u201019 infection in clinically relevant settings are urgently needed. Studies should recruit consecutive series of eligible participants, including both those presenting for testing due to symptoms and asymptomatic people who may have come into contact with confirmed cases. Studies should clearly describe symptomatic status and document time from symptom onset or time since exposure. Point\u2010of\u2010care tests must be conducted on samples according to manufacturer instructions for use and be conducted at the point of care. Any future research study report should conform to the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) guideline."

In the time of an epidemic crisis, we hoped artificial intelligence (AI) to help reduce physician workload in regions with the outbreak, and improve the diagnosis accuracy for physicians before they could acquire enough experience with the new disease. Here, we present our experience in building and deploying an AI system that automatically analyzes CT images to detect COVID-19 pneumonia features. Different from conventional medical AI, we were dealing with an epidemic crisis. Working in an interdisciplinary team of over 30 people with medical and / or AI background, geographically distributed in Beijing and Wuhan, we were able to overcome a series of challenges in this particular situation and deploy the system in four weeks. Using 1,136 training cases (723 positives for COVID-19) from five hospitals, we were able to achieve a sensitivity of 0.974 and specificity of 0.922 on the test dataset, which included a variety of pulmonary diseases. Besides, the system automatically highlighted all lesion regions for faster examination. As of today, we have deployed the system in 16 hospitals, and it is performing over 1,300 screenings per day."

In this study we aimed to determine seropositivity of COVID-19 virus infection in population of a highly affected area in north of Iran. Methods: In a population-based cluster random sampling design through phone call invitation, a total of 196 household including 552 subjects agreed to participate in this study. Each participant were taken 50ml blood sample at health care center. Rapid test kits were used to detect antibody against COVID-19. Crude, population-weight adjusted and test performance adjusted prevalence of antibody seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 were reported. Results: The prevalence of antibody seropositivity was 0.22 (95%CI: 0.19-0.26). The population weight adjusted estimate was 0.21 (95%CI: 0.14-0.29) and test performance adjusted prevalence was 0.33 (95%CI: 0.28-0.39). Based on these estimates the range of infected people in this province would be between 518000 and 777000. Conclusion: The population seropositivity prevalence of COVID-19 virus infection indicated that the asymptomatic infection is much higher than the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. This estimate can be used to better detect infection fatality rate and decide for public policy guidelines."

Numerous factors could influence the transmission rate and survival of coronavirus. On this basis and according to the latest epidemiological researches, both ambient temperature (AT) and population size (PS) can be considered as significant transmissibility factors for coronavirus. The analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) allows measuring the performance of a classification model using the confusion matrix. This study intends to investigate the sensitivity of AT and PS on the transmission rate of the novel coronavirus in different provinces of Iran. For this purpose, the information of each province of Iran including the annual average of AT and the number of healthy and diseased cases are categorized. Subsequently, the sensitivity and specificity analyses of both AT and PS factors are performed. The obtained results confirm that AT and PS have low sensibility and high sensitivity, respectively. Thus, there is no scientific reason to confirm that the number of COVID-19 cases in warmer climates is less than that of moderate or cold climates. Therefore, it is recommended that the cities/provinces with a population of over 1.7 million people have stricter inspections and more precise controls as their management policy.\n \n"

The main objective was to compare the accuracy of recently developed COVID-19 prognostic scores to that of CURB-65, Charlson and PROFUND indices in a cohort of 272 elderly patients from four nursing homes, affected by COVID-19. Accuracy was measured by calibration (calibration curves and Hosmer-Lemeshov (H-L) test), and discriminative power (area under the receiver operation curve (AUC-ROC). Negative and positive predictive values (NPV and PPV) were also obtained. Overall mortality rate was 22.4%. Only ACP and Shi et al. out of 10 specific COVID-19 indices could be assessed. All indices but CURB-65 showed a good calibration by H-L test, whilst PROFUND, ACP and CURB-65 showed best results in calibration curves. Only CURB-65 (AUC-ROC\u2009=\u20090.81 [0.75 to 0.87])) and PROFUND (AUC-ROC\u2009=\u20090.67 [0.6 to 0.75])) showed good discrimination power. The highest NPV was obtained by CURB-65 (95% [90 to 98%]), PROFUND (93% [77to 98%]), and their combination (100% [82 to 100%]); whereas CURB-65 (74% [51 to 88%]), and its combination with PROFUND (80% [50 to 94%]) showed highest PPV. PROFUND and CURB-65 indices showed the highest accuracy in predicting death-risk of elderly patients affected by COVID-19, whereas Charlson and recent developed COVID-19 specific tools lacked it, or were not available to assess. A comprehensive clinical stratification on two-level basis (basal death risk due to chronic conditions by PROFUND index, plus current death risk due to COVID-19 by CURB-65), could be an appropriate approach.\n \n"

The overall death rate of COVID-19 pneumonia in the Chinese population was 4%. Objectives: To describe the process of hospitalization and critical care of patients who died of COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: This was a multicenter observational study of 109 decedents with COVID-19 pneumonia from three hospitals in Wuhan. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed, and the final date of follow-up was February 24, 2020. Results: The mean age of 109 decedents with COVID-19 pneumonia was 70.7 years, 35 patients (32.1%) were female, and 85 patients (78.0%) suffered from one or more underlying comorbidities. Multiple organ failure, especially respiratory failure and heart failure, appeared in all patients even at the early stage of disease. Overall, the mean time from onset of symptoms to death was 22.3 days. All 109 hospitalized patients needed admission to an intensive care unit (ICU); however, because of limited availability, only 51 (46.8%) could be admitted. The period from hospitalization to death in the ICU group and non-ICU group was 15.9 days (standard deviation\u2009=\u20098.8 d) and 12.5 days (8.6 d, P\u2009=\u20090.044), respectively. Conclusions: Mortality due to COVID-19 pneumonia was concentrated in patients above the age of 65 years, especially those with major comorbidities. Patients who were admitted to the ICU lived longer than those who were not. Our findings should aid in the recognition and clinical management of such infections, especially with regard to ICU resource allocation."

COVID-19 is being compared to the infamous SARS coronavirus, which resulted, between November 2002 and July 2003, in 8098 confirmed cases worldwide with a 9.6% death rate and 774 deaths. Though COVID-19 has a death rate of 2.8% as of 20 February, the 75752 confirmed cases in a few weeks (December 8, 2019 to February 20, 2020) are alarming, with cases likely being under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period. Such outbreaks demand elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify COVID-19 as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves high levels of classification accuracy and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5,000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification."

There is a paucity of information on glycemic control among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with diabetes and acute hyperglycemia. Methods: This retrospective observational study of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 adults evaluated glycemic and clinical outcomes in patients with and without diabetes and/or acutely uncontrolled hyperglycemia hospitalized March 1 to April 6, 2020. Diabetes was defined as A1C \u22656.5%. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia was defined as \u22652 blood glucoses (BGs) > 180\u2009mg/dL within any 24-hour period. Data were abstracted from Glytec\u2019s data warehouse. Results: Among 1122 patients in 88 U.S. hospitals, 451 patients with diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia spent 37.8% of patient days having a mean BG > 180\u2009mg/dL. Among 570 patients who died or were discharged, the mortality rate was 28.8% in 184 diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia patients, compared with 6.2% of 386 patients without diabetes or hyperglycemia (P < .001). Among the 184 patients with diabetes and/or hyperglycemia who died or were discharged, 40 of 96 uncontrolled hyperglycemia patients (41.7%) died compared with 13 of 88 patients with diabetes (14.8%, P < .001). Among 493 discharged survivors, median length of stay (LOS) was longer in 184 patients with diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia compared with 386 patients without diabetes or hyperglycemia (5.7 vs 4.3\u2009days, P < .001). Conclusion: Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia occurred frequently. These COVID-19 patients with diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia had a longer LOS and markedly higher mortality than patients without diabetes or uncontrolled hyperglycemia. Patients with uncontrolled hyperglycemia had a particularly high mortality rate. We recommend health systems which ensure that inpatient hyperglycemia is safely and effectively treated."

A fresh figure of 2268011 positive cases and 155185 death records (till April 18th 2020) across the worldwide signify the severity of this viral infection. CoVID-19 infection is a pandemic, surface to surface communicable disease with a case fatality rate of 3.4% as estimated by WHO up to March 3rd 2020. Unfortunately, the current unavailability of an effective antiviral drug and approved vaccine, worsen the situation more critical. Implementation of an effective preventive measure is the only option left to counteract CoVID-19. Further, a retrospective analysis provides evidence that contemplates the decisive role of preventive measures in controlling severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. A statistical surveillance report of WHO reflects, maintaining a coherent infection, prevention and control guideline resulted in a 30% reduction in healthcare-associated infections. The effectiveness of preventive measures completely relies on the strength of surface disinfectants, the composition of hand sanitizer, appropriate material for the manufacture of personal protective equipment (PPE). This review enlightens the various preventive measures such as a suitable selection of surface disinfectants, appropriate hand sanitization, and empowering the PPE that could be a potential intervention to fight against CoVID-19.\n \n"

        "context": "Abstract Our understanding of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to evolve and there are many unknowns about its epidemiology. This study aims to synthesise case fatality rate (CFR) among confirmed COVID-19 patients, incubation period and time from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to first medical visit, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, recovery, and death. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, and bibliographies of relevant articles from 01 December 2019 to 11 March 2020 without any language restrictions. Quantitative studies that recruited people with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were included. Two independent reviewers extracted the data. Out of 1675 non-duplicate studies, 43 were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled mean incubation period was 5.68 (99% confidence interval [CI]: 4.78, 6.59) days. The pooled mean number of days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to first clinical visit was 4.92 (95% CI: 3.95, 5.90), ICU admission was 9.84 (95% CI: 8.78, 10.90), recovery was 18.55 (95% CI: 13.69, 23.41), and death was 15.93 (95% CI: 13.07, 18.79). Pooled CFR among confirmed COVID-19 patients was 0.02 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.03). We found that the incubation period and lag between the onset of symptoms and first clinical visit for COVID-19 are longer than other respiratory viral infections including Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome; however, the current policy of 14 days of mandatory quarantine for everyone potentially exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might be too conservative. Longer quarantine periods might be more justified for extreme cases."

        "context": "Establishing the equipoise between infection and rejection in any individual transplant recipient has always been the aim when prescribing immunosuppression. Today the world is facing a global pandemic which has never been seen in the era of transplantation and immunotherapy. As of April 7, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been confirmed in .1.25 million people worldwide with a mortality rate of 5.7%. The presence of comorbid conditions is associated with higher risk of death, which is concerning because significant comorbidity is common in recipients of transplants.1 The additional risk posed by immunosuppression in these patients cannot be estimated due to lack of data. Logically, transplant clinicians are needing to extrapolate from evidence obtained from treating other life-threatening infections in recipients of transplants, which involves reducing or stopping immunosuppression. At the time of writing, published data are available in 11 transplant patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (eight adult and three pediatric patients).2\u20136 Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are the cornerstone of transplant maintenance immunosuppressive regimens, and all patients were receiving CNIs at the time of diagnosis. In keeping with what is known in the general population, all pediatric outcomes were favorable. In the adult cases, seven of the eight case reports describe management that included withdrawal of both CNIs and antiproliferative agents; in these cases, outcomes were variable (three patients survived, three remain in critical care, and two deaths).2\u20134,6 Several guidelines have since been developed that recommend withdrawal of CNIs in transplant patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.7,8 Two features of CNIs, one experimental and the other clinical, warrant attention because they may have important repercussions not only for patients who have received a transplant but also in the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in general. Firstly, it is known that a number of viruses use active immunophilin pathways during their life cycle, and that CNIs may inhibit viral replication in vitro.9,10 Cyclosporine, for example, has been shown to inhibit the replication of several coronaviruses in vitro at noncytotoxic concentrations and independently of its immunosuppressive effect.10,11 In addition, the inhibitory effect of cyclosporine on hepatitis C virus replication in vitro is well documented.12However, the observed longer time to hepatitis C virus recurrence after liver transplantation in patients treatedwith cyclosporine comparedwith tacrolimus suggests a discordance in vivo between the different CNIs.12 Focusing explicitly on SARS-CoV infection, a genome-wide analysis of protein-protein interactionsbetweenSARS-CoVandhuman host proteins identified both cyclophilin family members and FK506 (tacrolimus)-binding proteins as interaction partners for SARS-CoV proteins.9 In addition, both FK506 treatment and knock down of FK506-binding proteins 1A and 1B inhibited SARS-CoV replication in vitro.13 This suggests that both commonly prescribed CNIs, cyclosporine and tacrolimus, have inhibitory potential in SARS-CoV. Althoughwe do not advocate the use of these drugs for their potential antiviral properties based solely on these experimental observations in related viruses, these findings may support their continued use as the preferred maintenance immunosuppressant in transplant recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, given that withdrawal of CNIs may result in increased corticosteroid usage in this population, it is also prudent to consider that there appears to be no therapeutic benefit from corticosteroid therapy in SARS-CoVand there maywell bedeleterious effects, acknowledging there are differences in the replacement dosage used in transplantation.14,15 Secondly, emerging evidence suggests acute respiratory distress syndrome is the leading cause of death after infection with SARS-CoV-2, and severe disease may be associated with a hyperinflammatory state"

We find an excess mortality that is correlated in time with the COVID-19 reported death rate time series. Our analysis shows good agreement with reported COVID-19 mortality for age<70 years, but an excess in total mortality increasing with age above 70 years, suggesting there is a large population of predominantly old people missing from the official fatality statistics. We estimate that the number of COVID-19 deaths in Italy is 52,000 \u00b1 2000 as of April 18 2020, more than a factor of 2 higher than the official number. The Population Fatality Rate (PFR) has reached 0.22% in the most affected region of Lombardia and 0.57% in the most affected province of Bergamo,which constitutes a lower bound to the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR). We estimate PFR as a function of age, finding a steep age dependence: in Lombardia (Bergamo province) 0.6% (1.7%) of the total population in age group 70-79 died, 1.6% (4.6%) in age group 80-89, and 3.41% (10.2%) in the age group above 90. We combine this with the Test Positivity Rate to estimate the lower bound of 0.84% on the IFR for Lombardia. We observe IFR to trace the Yearly Mortality Rate (YMR) above 60 years, which can be used to estimate the IFR for other regions in the world. We predict an IFR lower bound of 0.5% for NYC and 26% of total COVID-19 mortality arising from the population below 65 years, in agreement with the existing data and several times higher than Lombardia. Combining PFR with the Princess Diamond cruise ship IFR for ages above 70 we estimate the infection rates(IR) of regions in Italy, which peak in Lombardia at 23% (12%-41%, 95% c.l.), and for provinces in Bergamo at 67% (33%-100%, 95% c.l.). This suggests that Bergamo may have reached herd immunity, and that the number of infected people greatly exceeds the number of positive tests, by a factor of 35 in Lombardia."

The initial source of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, with pangolins as a potential animal host. Currently the main source of infection is NCP patients, and asymptomatic carriers may also be infectious. The virus is believed transmitted mostly via droplets or contact. People are all generally susceptible to the virus. The average incubation period was 5.2 days, and the basic reproductive number R(0) was 2.2 at the onset of the outbreak. Most NCP patients were clinically mild cases. The case fatality rate was 2.38%, and elderly men with underlying diseases were at a higher risk of death. Strategies for prevention and control of NCP include improving epidemic surveillance, quarantining the source of infection, speeding up the diagnosis of suspected cases, optimizing the management of close contacts, tightening prevention and control of cluster outbreaks and hospital infection, preventing possible rebound of the epidemic after people return to work from the Chinese Spring Festival holiday, and strengthening community prevention and control."

Affecting around 260 000 globally and claiming the lives of around 12 000 COVID-19 has affected the very basis of living, leading to mass panic and hysteria. Symptoms at mild stage are mainly dry cough, sore throat, fever, malaise, and fatigue. However, in severe cases pneumonia can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure, eventually leading to death. The mortality rate is 2% to 3% which is much lower compared to its earlier congeners like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Having said that, COVID-19 is more contagious. The severity and fatality of COVID-19 has been directly related to age and immunecompromised states, as 15% of the first wave of deaths in China were aged above 60 years. According to Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the mortality rate in age group 60 to 69 years is 3.6% which can reach up to 18% at 80 years and above. World Health Organization in its guidelines has recommended strict social isolation in the geriatric population to control the deaths in heavily affected countries.

It informs on both undiagnosed cases and on the effects of health system disruption. Methods: We aimed at evaluating the extent of the total death excess during the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy. Data from 4433 municipalities providing mortality reports until April 15th, 2020 were included for a total of 34.5 million residents from all Italian regions. Data were analyzed by region, sex and age, and compared to expected from 2015\u20132019. Results: In both genders, overall mortality was stable until February 2020 and abruptly increased from March 1st onwards. Within the municipalities studied, 77,339 deaths were observed in the period between March 1st to April 15th, 2020, in contrast to the 50,822.6 expected. The rate ratio was 1.11 before age 60 and 1.55 afterwards. Both sexes were affected. The excess was greater in the regions most affected by COVID-19 but always exceeded the deaths attributed to COVID-19. The extrapolation to the total Italian population suggests an excess of 45,033 deaths in the study period, while the number of COVID\u201319 deaths was 21,046. Conclusion: Our paper shows a large death excess during the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy; greater than the number attributed to it. Possible causes included both the undetected cases and the disruption of the Health Service organization. Timely monitoring of overall mortality based on unbiased nationwide data is an essential tool for epidemic control."

Many patients with COVID-19 have symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome, even are in danger of death. This is the first study to evaluate dynamic changes of D-Dimer and Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Count Ratio (NLR) as a prognostic utility in patients with COVID-19 for clinical use. Methods In a retrospective study, we collected data from 349 hospitalized patients who diagnosed as the infection of the COVID-19 in Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. We used ROC curves and Cox regression analysis to explore critical value (optimal cut-off point associated with Youden index) and prognostic role of dynamic changes of D-Dimer and NLR. Results Three hundred forty-nine participants were enrolled in this study and the mortality rate of the patients with laboratory diagnosed COVID-19 was 14.9%. The initial and peak value of D-Dimer and NLR in deceased patients were higher statistically compared with survivors ( P \u2009<\u20090.001). There was a more significant upward trend of D-Dimer and NLR during hospitalization in the deceased patients, initial D-Dimer and NLR were lower than the peak tests (MD) -25.23, 95% CI: \u2212\u200931.81- -18.64, P \u2009<\u20090.001; (MD) -43.73, 95% CI:-59.28- -31.17, P \u2009<\u20090.001. The test showed a stronger correlation between hospitalization days, PCT and peak D-Dimer than initial D-Dimer. The areas under the ROC curves of peak D-Dimer and peak NLR tests were higher than the initial tests (0.94(95%CI: 0.90\u20130.98) vs. 0.80 (95% CI: 0.73\u20130.87); 0.93 (95%CI:0.90\u20130.96) vs. 0.86 (95%CI:0.82\u20130.91). The critical value of initial D-Dimer, peak D-Dimer, initial NLR and peak NLR was 0.73\u2009mg/L, 3.78\u2009mg/L,7.13 and 14.31 respectively. 35 (10.03%) patients were intubated. In the intubated patients, initial and peak D-Dimer and NLR were much higher than non-intubated patients ( P \u00a0<\u20090.001). The critical value of initial D-Dimer, peak D-Dimer, initial NLR and peak NLR in prognosticate of intubation was 0.73\u2009mg/L, 12.75\u2009mg/L,7.28 and 27.55. The multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that age (HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00\u20131.07, P \u2009=\u20090.01), the peak D-Dimer (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.04, P \u2009<\u20090.001) were prognostic factors for COVID-19 patients\u2019 death. Conclusions To dynamically observe the ratio of D-Dimer and NLR was more valuable during the prognosis of COVID-19. The rising trend in D-Dimer and NLR, or the test results higher than the critical values may indicate a risk of death for participants with COVID-19."

Methods:\nAll patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 1 and\nSeptember 30, 2020, were retrospectively identified and characterized\nthrough electronic analysis at Stanford. A sub-cohort was followed\nprospectively to evaluate long-term COVID-19 symptoms. Results: 168,190\npatients underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, and 6,976 (4\u00b715%) tested\npositive. In a multivariate analysis, asthma was not an independent risk\nfactor for hospitalization (OR 1\u00b712 [95% CI 0\u00b786, 1\u00b745], p=0\u00b740).\nAmong SARS-CoV-2 positive asthmatics, allergic asthma lowered the risk\nof hospitalization and had a protective effect compared to non-allergic\nasthma (OR 0\u00b752 (0\u00b728, 0\u00b791), p=0\u00b7026); there was no association between\nbaseline medication use as characterized by GINA and hospitalization\nrisk. Patients with severe COVID-19 disease had lower eosinophil levels\nduring hospitalization compared to patients with mild or asymptomatic\ndisease, independent of asthma status (p=0.0014). In a patient\nsub-cohort followed longitudinally, asthmatics and non-asthmatics had\nsimilar time to resolution of COVID-19 symptoms, particularly lower\nrespiratory symptoms. Conclusions: Asthma is not a risk factor for more\nsevere COVID-19 disease. Allergic asthmatics were half as likely to be\nhospitalized with COVID-19 compared to non-allergic asthmatics. Lower\nlevels of eosinophil counts (allergic biomarkers) were associated with\nmore severe COVID-19 disease trajectory. Recovery was similar among\nasthmatics and non-asthmatics with over 50% of patients reporting\nongoing lower respiratory symptoms three months post-infection."

        "context": "\n The majority of COVID-19 survivors experience long-term neuropsychiatric symptoms such as fatigue, sleeping difficulties, depression and anxiety. We propose that neuroimmune cross-talk via inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) could underpin these long-term COVID-19 symptoms. This hypothesis is supported by several lines of research, including population-based cohort and genetic Mendelian Randomisation studies suggesting that inflammation is associated with fatigue and sleeping difficulties, and that IL-6 could represent a possible causal driver for these symptoms. Immune activation following COVID-19 can disrupt T helper 17 (TH17) and regulatory T (Treg) cell responses, affect central learning and emotional processes, and lead to a vicious cycle of inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction that amplifies the inflammatory process and results in immuno-metabolic constraints on neuronal energy metabolism, with fatigue being the ultimate result. Increased cytokine activity drives this process and could be targeted to interrupt it. Therefore, whether persistent IL-6 dysregulation contributes to COVID-19-related long-term fatigue, sleeping difficulties, depression, and anxiety, and whether targeting IL-6 pathways could be helpful for treatment and prevention of long COVID are important questions that require investigation. This line of research could inform new approaches for treatment and prevention of long-term neuropsychiatric symptoms of COVID-19. Effective treatment and prevention of this condition could also help to stem the anticipated rise in depression and other mental illnesses ensuing this pandemic.\n"

This illness is mysterious as it affects COVID-19 survivors at all levels of disease severity, even younger adults and children. While the precise definition may be lacking, the defining symptoms are fatigue, dyspnea, and headache that last for months after hospital discharge. The less typical symptoms may include cognitive impairments, chest and joint pains, myalgia, smell and taste dysfunctions, cough, mood changes, and gastrointestinal and cardiac issues. Presently, there is limited literature discussing the possible pathophysiology, risk factors, and treatments in long-haul COVID-19, which the current review aims to address. In brief, long-haul COVID-19 may be driven by long-term lung and brain damage and unresolved inflammation from multiple sources. The associated risk factors may include female sex, more than five early symptoms, early dyspnea, and specific biomarkers like D-dimer. While only rehabilitation training has been useful for long-haul COVID-19, therapeutics repurposed from mast cell activation syndrome, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis also hold potential. In sum, this review hopes to provide the current understanding of what is known about long-haul COVID-19."

Here we describe the phenotypic and functional characteristics of B and T cells in healthy individuals and individuals with acute or convalescent COVID-19. We report that the alterations in B cell subsets observed in acute COVID-19 patients were largely recovered in convalescent patients. In contrast, T cells from convalescent patients displayed long-term alterations with persistence of a cytotoxic programme evident in CD8+\u00a0T cells as well as elevated production of type-1 cytokines and IL-17. Interestingly, B cells from patients with acute COVID-19 displayed an IL-6/ IL-10 cytokine imbalance in response to toll-like receptor activation, skewed towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Whereas the frequency of IL-10+\u00a0B cells was restored in a subset of convalescent patients, IL-6 production remained elevated. Our data are the first to define long-term alterations in the lymphocyte compartment of previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients, at up to 19 weeks of convalescence, and identify 3 subgroups of convalescent patients based on distinct lymphocyte phenotypes.

        "context": "\u201cScience wins over coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\u201d, the headlines are saying. With incredible speed, while not sacrificing scientific rigor, various companies have produced vaccines proven to be safe and effective for prevention of COVID-19 infection. The pandemic we have been living in since early 2020 will now have a fierce combatant to deal with; and if all goes as expected, herd immunity will become a reality and the pandemic will be controlled. This is an amazing feat from a population perspective, but should women have specific concerns as they consider receiving the vaccine, or not? A few key facts deserve receiving emphasis: 1) The COVID-19 vaccines that are being initially approved (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) are messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines. The mRNA is encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle and delivered into the host cells. The host\u2019s cells then produce coronavirus spike protein which leads to production of antibodies against this foreign antigen. Unlike many other currently used vaccines, these vaccines are not live virus vaccines, do not enter the nucleus of host cells, and do not alter the human deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the host. No genetic changes can occur in the host [1]. 2) Pregnant women, especially those from underserved populations, are susceptible to more severe forms of COVID-19 infection compared to non-pregnant women [2]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has listed pregnant women as a population at higher risk for severe consequences from COVID-19 infection, including intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for mechanical ventilation and death. Although the risk is very low, these increased risks are disproportionately prevalent in minority, lower socioeconomic status populations [3]. 3) For lactating women, while breastfeeding, the inherent risks of severe COVID-19 infection is similar to the general population. Thus, the safety risks of vaccination do not outweigh the benefits achieved by a breastfeeding infant [1]. 4) Women contemplating getting pregnant, or at risk for pregnancy should be treated as anyone in the general population. Routine pregnancy testing, delaying pregnancy, or withholding the second dose in a patient who already received the first dose of the vaccine are not necessary based on the theoretical safety concerns regarding these vaccines [1]. 5) Although administration of a COVID-19 vaccine can be associated with side effects such as fever, pain, and other influenza-like symptoms, a recipient cannot get COVID-19 infection from the vaccine. The approved COVID-19 vaccines have not been specifically tested in pregnant women and as such there is no safety data related to pregnancy. However, there is no biologically-plausible theoretical basis for withholding the vaccines from pregnant individuals. How about women who decide against receiving the vaccine when it becomes available to them? That decision should be respected, but a conversation should occur with her care provider to ascertain that her decision is being made in the face of as accurate information as is available to her. The risks associated with not getting vaccinated should also be openly discussed, including the risk exposure at work or elsewhere and then exposing household members such as parents, children and other susceptible individuals. Education may be needed to allay any specific fears that a woman may have. Regardless of whether a woman receives the vaccine, or not, preventive measures such as physical distancing, frequent hand washing and wearing a face mask should be followed until such a time as the public health authorities announce that preventive measures can be relaxed. As vaccination reaches less developed parts of the world, where access to ICU beds, specific anti-viral therapies and other treatments available in developed countries is limited, the key role a vaccine plays in controlling the pandemic is even more critical. Access to vaccination will certainly be very challenging in many parts of the world where geographic and economic barriers can be paramount. Current vaccines which require transportation at sub-freezing temperature and administration in multiple doses, may not be practical in many parts of the world. Those areas may have to wait for further advances in vaccine technology which may be transported at room temperature and be effective with a single dose. An enormous amount of data is being generated on a daily basis relative to COVID-19 infection and the role of vaccination in controlling its spread. As care providers for women, it is our role to help educate our patients about the role of vaccination in controlling this very serious viral pandemic. As specific populations such as pregnant women are studied, our knowledge base regarding the current COVID-19 vaccines (and forthcoming vaccines) will expand greatly, and facilitate us in helping patients make educated decisions about Manuscript submitted December 16, 2020, accepted December 22, 2020 Published online December 30, 2020"

The hallmarks of a successful vaccine are safety and efficacy. Analytical evaluation methods, that can ensure the high quality of the products and that can be executed speedily, must be in place as an integral component of Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC). These methods or assays are developed to quantitatively test for critical quality attributes (CQAs) of a vaccine product. While clinical (human) efficacy of a vaccine can never be predicted from pre-clinical evaluation of CQA, precise and accurate measurements of antigen content and a relevant biological activity (termed \u201cpotency\u201d) elicited by the antigen allow selection of potentially safe and immunogenic doses for entry into clinical trials. All available vaccine technology platforms, novel and traditional, are being utilized by different developers to produce vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. It took less than a year from the publication of SARS-CoV-2 gene sequence to Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of the first vaccine, setting a record for speed in the history of vaccine development. The largest ever global demand for vaccines has prompted some vaccine developers to enter multiple manufacturing partnerships in different countries in addition to implementing unprecedented scale-up plans. Quantitative, robust, and rapid analytical testing for CQA of a product is essential in ensuring smooth technology transfer between partners and allowing analytical bridging between vaccine batches used in different clinical phases leading up to regulatory approvals and commercialization. We discuss here opportunities to improve the speed and quality of the critical batch release and characterization assays."

        "context": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic gripped the world unexpectedly and little was known about the virus or its effects on various cohorts of patients. In the first wave, rheumatology patients on immunosuppressive agents were asked to shield or self-isolate because they were deemed highly clinically vulnerable. As evidence emerged, it became apparent that most of our patients were not adversely affected with their disease management and so it gradually returned to normal.1 Nevertheless, in light of the second wave much uncertainty remains. In this regard, the COVID-19 vaccine is eagerly anticipated to be one of the solutions to the pandemic. Emergence of several potential vaccines has been the topic of discussion in recent weeks. In this Editorial we explore the emerging vaccines and the perception, anxieties, and concerns around them from a rheumatology perspective. COVID-19 vaccines are being developed by various pharmaceutical companies but there are three that seem to be the most promising. Pfizer/BioNTechs COVID-19 vaccine is an RNA vaccine, which is reported to be 95% effective against COVID-19 and is currently in phase 3 of its trials with over 43 000 participants; 41% of global and 45% of US participants are between 56 and 85 years, and 42% of the overall study population have a diverse ethnic background including Asian, Black, Hispanic, and Native American. Most participants have received a second dose as part of a two-dose regimen, but the details of this regimen have not been released.2 Moderna, has also developed an RNA-based vaccine, which is up to 94.5% effective when given over two doses on days 1 and 29.3 The clinical trial cohort includes over 30 000 participants including 7000 over 65 years of age and 5000 participants under 65 years of age with high-risk chronic diseases. AstraZeneca has produced a slightly different COVID-19 vaccine consisting of a viral vector, which is 90% effective when using one of its vaccination regimens consisting of giving a half dose initially then a full dose 1 month later. The trial population is slightly smaller than the others with over 23 000 participants and it is being conducted in the UK, Brazil and South Africa. The cohort consists of participants who are healthy and have medically stable chronic diseases.4 At the time of writing this editorial (November 2020), the results of the phase 3 trials of these three vaccines are yet to be published and peer-reviewed, therefore available data so far are limited to press-releases. Efficacy and safety of these emerging vaccines in the rheumatology population are unknown. It is unclear in the trials which chronic disease patient groups were included or if they were on immunosuppressive therapy. Published phase 1/2 trial data included healthy patients between the ages of 18 and 55 years, patient demographics for phase 3 trials have not been released. However, as none of these vaccines are live attenuated it is assumed that they are safe to be taken by patients on immunosuppressive treatment. The main resistance we envisage with some of the rheumatology patients in taking the vaccine is likely to be their perception rather than scientific reasoning. The RNA vaccine is the first of its kind and understandably we are all apprehensive, as little is known about the long-term side effects of this novel vaccine. So far, none of the three pharmaceutical companies has reported any serious short-term adverse effects. The most common side effects have been fatigue and headache, similar to the influenza vaccine.2,3 The relationship between vaccination uptake and perception is complex. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) controversy in 1998 demonstrates how MMR vaccine uptake fell in subsequent years and the efforts of health authorities to rebuild public trust. Knowledge is power, and educating parents on the correct information was key after the MMR controversy. Milward describes certain features that affect public perception of health messages, which include the relevance of information to everyday life, its relation to other perceived risks, and the extent to which the source of information is trusted.5 Information sourced from informal sources on the internet, social media, and print media will have a potential negative impact. Rheumatology patients are eager to have more information regarding the COVID-19 vaccine so that they can make an informed decision about their long-term disease management. Reflecting on times when vaccines have been introduced or publicized, we can appreciate how the distribution of data regarding their safety and use is imperative to enable rational patient decisions. There are other factors that influence patients\u2019 health decisions on a personal level, which include cultural norms, and religious, educational, and philosophical views, which can all influence attitudes to vaccinations.6 Many patients also rely on the advice and opinion of their healthcare professional and so disseminating accurate information is vital. The concept of vaccination is based on herd immunity where most people in a population have immunity against an infection either directly by previous infection or indirectly via a vaccine to reduce the risk of transmission to those who lack immunity.7 The proportion of people that need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity depends on the infection, for example for measles it is 95%, for polio it is 80%.8 Nevertheless, it is usually most of the population that needs to be vaccinated to protect those who cannot be"

        "context": "The Covid-19 pandemic has brought about rapid change in medical science. The production of new generation vaccines for this disease has surprised even their most optimistic supporters. Not only have these vaccines proven to be effective, but the importance of this disease and pandemic situation also significantly shortened the long-standing process of validating such products. Vaccination is a type of immunotherapy. Researchers have long been looking at vaccines as a possible treatment for cancer (Geynisman et al., 2014). In the same way that vaccines work against infectious diseases, attempts are being made to develop vaccines to identify specific proteins on cancer cells. This helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. Cancer vaccines may help: I) Prevent the growth of cancer cells (Bialkowski et al., 2016), II) Prevent recurrence of cancer (Stanton and Disis, 2015), III) Destroy cancer cells left over from other treatments. The following types of cancer vaccines are being studied: Antigen Vaccines. These vaccines are made from specific proteins or antigens of cancerous cells. Their purpose is to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells (Tagliamonte et al., 2014). Whole-Cell Vaccines. A whole-cell vaccine uses the entire cancer cell, not just a specific molecule (antigen), to generate the vaccine. (Keenan and Jaffee, 2012).Dendritic Cell Vaccines. Dendritic cells help the immune system identify abnormal cells, such as cancerous cells. Dendritic cells are grown with cancer cells in the laboratory to produce the vaccine. The vaccine then stimulates the immune system to attack cancer. (Wang et al., 2014; Mastelic-Gavillet et al., 2019). DNA Vaccines. These vaccines are made from DNA fragments of cancer cells. They can be injected into the body to facilitate immune system cells can better respond and kill cancer cells (Gatti-Mays et al., 2017).Other Types of Cancer Vaccines. such as Anti idiotype vaccines. This vaccine stimulates the body to generate antibodies against cancerous cells. An example of an anti-idiotype antibody is Racotumomab or Vaxira (Cancer, 2016). However, conditions and considerations after Corona does not seem to be the same as before. The current pandemic situation has also led to major changes in the pharmaceutical and Vaccine production process and international protocols. Some of the most critical issues that can accelerate the introduction of cancer vaccines are: 1. Typical drug and vaccine development timeline. A typical vaccine needs 5 to 10 years and sometimes longer to design secure funding, and get approval (Figure 1). Less than 10 percent of new drugs, which are entered in the different phases of clinical trials, are advanced to approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)(Cancer, 2020a). However, now the situation is not normal. Dozens of Covid 19 vaccines are starting clinical trials. Some of them use RNA and DNA technology, which delivers the body with missions to produce its antibodies against the virus. There are already at least 254 therapies and 95 vaccines related to Covid-19 being explored. However, it seems that the experiences gained in this pandemic, and advances in technology, may be effective in shortening the production path of other vaccines and drugs and the process of its approval at the national and international levels in the future. In Figure 2, the time course of production of conventional vaccines in comparison with Covid 19 vaccines (Cancer, 2020b) is shown.2. The introduction of messenger RNA (mRNA) technology into the field of prevention and treatment. Over the past decades, this technology has been considered an excellent alternative to conventional vaccination methods. Proper potency and low side effects, the possibility of fast production and relatively low production cost are its advantages. However, until recently, the instability of this molecule has been a major problem in its application. This research was started many years ago by two companies that played a significant role in developing the first Covid vaccines, so BioNTech and Moderna were able to quickly transfer their experience in the field of Covid vaccine development (Pardi et al., 2018; Moderna, 2020). Figure 3 shows how mRNA vaccines work. Bout Pfizer \u2013 BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines were more than 90 % effective in preclinical stages. Millions of doses of these two vaccines are currently being injected into eligible individuals worldwide. 3. Considering the use of artificial intelligence in assessing the effectiveness of vaccines. There are always doubts about the effectiveness of the new drug in treating the disease. Once the vaccine is widely available, we will know more about its effectiveness versus it works under carefully controlled scientific testing conditions. Vaccines will continue to be monitored after use. The data collected helps professionals understand how they work in different groups of people (depending on factors such as age, ethnicity, and people with different health conditions) and also the length of protection provided by the vaccine. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging field, which reaches everywhere and not only as a beneficial industrial tool but also as a practical tool in medical science and plays a crucial role in developing the computation vision, risk assessment, diagnostic, prognostic, etc. models in the field of medicine (Amisha et al., 2019). According to the wide range of AI applications in the analysis of different types of data, it can be used in vaccine production, safety assessments, clinical and preclinical studies and Covid 19 vaccines adverse reactions (CDC, 2019). Indeed, most cancer vaccines are therapeutic, rather than prophylactic, and seek to stimulate cell-mediated responses, such as those from CTLs, capable of clearing or reducing tumor burden. There are currently FDA-approved products for helping cancer treatment such as BREYANZI, TECARTUS and YESCARTA for lymphoma, IMLYGIC for melanoma, KYMRIAH for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and PROVENGE for prostate cancer. Over the past decade, most of BioNTech's activities have been in the field of cancer vaccine design and production for melanoma (two clinical trials), breast cancer (one clinical trial), and the rest concerning viral and veterinary vaccines (two clinical trials). Also Maderno company has been working on Individualized cancer vaccines (one clinical trials), and vaccines for viral infections such as Zika and Influenza and veterinary vaccines (several clinical trials) (Pardi et al., 2018). Therefore, it can be said, mRNA technology that has been the subject of much research into the treatment of cancer has been shifted and rapidly used to produce and use the Covid 19 vaccine. The current pandemic situation has necessitated the acceleration of Covid 19 vaccines and drugs and national and international protocols for their approval. If the currently produced vaccines can continue to be as successful as the preclinical and early phase studies, these changes and evolution have raised hopes for accelerating the use of these technologies and mechanisms in the field of cancer and other diseases vaccines, including HIV and influenza."

The optimal status of specific nutrients is considered crucial to keeping immune components within their normal activity, helping to avoid and overcome infections. Specifically, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) evaluated and deems six vitamins (D, A, C, Folate, B6, B12) and four minerals (zinc, iron, copper and selenium) to be essential for the normal functioning of the immune system, due to the scientific evidence collected so far. In this report, an update on the evidence of the contribution of nutritional factors as immune-enhancing aspects, factors that could reduce their bioavailability, and the role of the optimal status of these nutrients within the COVID-19 pandemic context was carried out. First, a non-systematic review of the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of an optimal nutritional status of these nutrients on the proper functioning of the immune system as well as their potential role in COVID-19 prevention/treatment was carried out by searching for available scientific evidence in PubMed and LitCovid databases. Second, a compilation from published sources and an analysis of nutritional data from 10 European countries was performed, and the relationship between country nutritional status and epidemiological COVID-19 data (available in the Worldometers database) was evaluated following an ecological study design. Furthermore, the potential effect of genetics was considered through the selection of genetic variants previously identified in Genome-Wide Association studies (GWAs) as influencing the nutritional status of these 10 considered nutrients. Therefore, access to genetic information in accessible databases (1000genomes, by Ensembl) of individuals from European populations enabled an approximation that countries might present a greater risk of suboptimal status of the nutrients studied. Results from the review approach show the importance of maintaining a correct nutritional status of these 10 nutrients analyzed for the health of the immune system, highlighting the importance of Vitamin D and iron in the context of COVID-19. Besides, the ecological study demonstrates that intake levels of relevant micronutrients\u2014especially Vitamins D, C, B12, and iron\u2014are inversely associated with higher COVID-19 incidence and/or mortality, particularly in populations genetically predisposed to show lower micronutrient status. In conclusion, nutrigenetic data provided by joint assessment of 10 essential nutrients for the functioning of the immune system and of the genetic factors that can limit their bioavailability can be a fundamental tool to help strengthen the immune system of individuals and prepare populations to fight against infectious diseases such as COVID-19."

Efforts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus (CoV) infections such as MERS and SARS in the past decades. However, to date, no licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists for MERS and SARS. Most of the efforts for developing CoV vaccines and drugs target the spike glycoprotein or S protein, the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Although a few candidates have shown efficacy in in vitro studies, not many have progressed to randomized animal or human trials, hence may have limited use to counter COVID-19 infection. This article highlights ongoing advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics to counter COVID-19 while also focusing on such experiences and advances as made with earlier SARS- and MERS-CoVs, which together could enable efforts to halt this emerging virus infection."

This has brought hope to millions of Americans in the midst of an ongoing global pandemic. The FDA EUA guidance for both vaccines is to not administer the vaccine to individuals with a known history of a severe allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) to any component of the COVID-19 vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) additionally advises individuals with a history of an immediate allergic reaction to a vaccine or injectable or any history of anaphylaxis be observed for 30 minutes after COVID-19 vaccination. All other individuals should be observed for 15 minutes after COVID-19 vaccination. Staff at vaccine clinics must be able to identify and manage anaphylaxis. Post\u2013FDA EUA, despite very strong safety signals in both phase 3 trials, reports of possible allergic reactions have raised public concern. To provide reassurance and support during widespread global vaccination, allergists must offer clear guidance to individuals based on the best information available, but also in accordance with the broader recommendations of regulatory agencies. This review summarizes vaccine allergy epidemiology and proposes drug and vaccine allergy expert opinion informed risk stratification for Allergy specialist use in conjunction with guidance of public health and regulatory authorities. The risk stratification schema guide care for (1) individuals with different allergy histories to safely receive their first mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and (2) individuals who develop a reaction to their first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.\n"

        "context": "ABSTRACT Despite major advances in vaccination over the past century, resurgence of vaccine-preventable illnesses has led the World Health Organization to identify vaccine hesitancy as a major threat to global health. Vaccine hesitancy may be fueled by health information obtained from a variety of sources, including new media such as the Internet and social media platforms. As access to technology has improved, social media has attained global penetrance. In contrast to traditional media, social media allow individuals to rapidly create and share content globally without editorial oversight. Users may self-select content streams, contributing to ideological isolation. As such, there are considerable public health concerns raised by anti-vaccination messaging on such platforms and the consequent potential for downstream vaccine hesitancy, including the compromise of public confidence in future vaccine development for novel pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2 for the prevention of COVID-19. In this review, we discuss the current position of social media platforms in propagating vaccine hesitancy and explore next steps in how social media may be used to improve health literacy and foster public trust in vaccination."

The disease condition associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the third highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21st century. The continuing emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant threat to human health and economy. Ironically, even after a decade of research on coronavirus, still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat coronavirus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics. Several clinical, genetic and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resemble SARS-CoV infection. Hence, the research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help scientific community in quick understanding of this virus pathogenesis and develop effective therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this infection. Monoclonal antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for passive immunotherapy to fight against viral infection. The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many diseases. Here, we summarize the potential monoclonal antibody based therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 by considering the existing knowledge on the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against similar coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Further research on COVID-19 pathogenesis could identify appropriate therapeutic targets to develop specific anti-virals against this newly emerging pathogen."

Convalescent plasma, donated by persons who have recovered from COVID-19, is the acellular component of blood that contains antibodies, including those that specifically recognize SARS-CoV-2. These antibodies, when transfused into patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, are thought to exert an antiviral effect, suppressing virus replication before patients have mounted their own humoral immune responses2,3. Virus-specific antibodies from recovered persons are often the first available therapy for an emerging infectious disease, a stopgap treatment while new antivirals and vaccines are being developed1,2.

However, when using NPS RT-qPCR at busy airport quarantine stations, there are constraints on testing capacity, time, travelerstolerance, and availability of personal protective equipment for quarantine officers. A feasible alternative is therefore needed to test incoming travelers, especially when passenger numbers increase with the resumption of business, tourism, and economic activities. To explore alternatives to NPS RT-qPCR, we collected nasopharyngeal, anterior nasal, and saliva samples chronologically over days 1-7 from asymptomatic COVID-19 air travelers who were under quarantine at a designated facility, and we then compared test results for 9 different methods, comprising RT-qPCR (including the reference method), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), and qualitative and quantitative antigen testing. We evaluated sensitivity for 97 person-day samples independently to evaluate asymptomatic travelers regardless of their testing date and period of asymptomatic status upon entry. Sensitivity of the different tests varied from 46.6% to 81.0%, but this was improved from 72.7% to 100.0% when the viral load was > 10 4 copies/sample on NPS RT-qPCR. Thus, most high-risk asymptomatic travelers with higher viral load would be detected by the tests evaluated. Quantitative antigen testing using saliva samples showed 90.9% sensitivity and provided quicker results, and should be an acceptable alternative to NPS RT-qPCR at busy airport quarantine stations. We discuss the implications of our exploratory findings for establishing a comprehensive and feasible testing strategy for COVID-19 among air passengers."

However, research on the psychological effects of the pandemic on the general population, particularly pregnant women, is lacking. Accordingly, the present study investigated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on depression and anxiety in pregnant women.Study design: An anonymous survey for assessing depression and anxiety in pregnant women was designed, after which a link to the online questionnaire was sent to the participants, who were being treated in a private medical center. One of the researchers followed up with the respondents, among whom 260 returned their questionnaires.Results: Among the respondents, 35.4% (n\u2009=\u200992, case group) obtained scores higher than 13 on the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS). The comparison of the groups by years of education indicated statistically significant effects of COVID-19 on psychology, social isolation, and mean scores in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). These effects were more severe in the case group than in the control group (psychology: 8.369\u2009\u00b1\u20092.003, social isolation: 8.000\u2009\u00b1\u20092.507, mean BDI and BAI scores: 20.565\u2009\u00b1\u20096.605 and 22.087\u2009\u00b1\u20098.689, respectively). A regression analysis revealed that the BDI scores and the disease's psychological effects, as well as the BAI scores and the illness's social isolation effects, exerted a statistically significant influence on the EPDS scores of the participants.Conclusion: This study illustrated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the depression and anxiety levels of pregnant women. Our results point to an urgent need to provide psychosocial support to this population during the crisis. Otherwise, adverse events may occur during pregnancy and thus affect both mother and fetus."

In an online survey of a representative sample of Canadian adults (n\u202f=\u202f1055), we found that higher neuroticism and extroversion were associated with higher levels of stress during the pandemic and a greater increase in stress levels compared to levels before the pandemic. Perceived threat and efficacy significantly mediated the relationship between neuroticism and stress, which suggested that individuals with higher neuroticism experienced higher levels of stress due to higher levels of perceived threat and lower levels of efficacy. Perceived threat did not mediate the relationship between extroverts and stress, which suggested that the source of stress may stem from elsewhere (e.g., inability to socialize). Our findings highlighted that personality traits could be an important factor in identifying stress-prone individuals during a pandemic and that stress management interventions need to be personality specific.\n \n"

Overall, 19% of hospitalised patients required non-invasive ventilation (44 studies, 6,513 patients), 17% required intensive care (33 studies, 7504 patients), 9% required invasive ventilation (45 studies, 6933 patients) and 2% required extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (12 studies, 1,486 patients). The mortality rate was 7% (73 studies, 10,402 patients). Conclusions We confirm that fever and cough are the most prevalent symptoms of adults infected by SARS-CoV-2. However, there is a large proportion of infected adults which symptoms-alone do not identify."

SARS-CoV-2 has spread to 210 countries worldwide and more than 6,500,000 confirmed cases and 384,643 deaths have been reported, while the number of both confirmed and fatal cases is continually increasing. COVID-19 is a viral disease that can affect every age group\u2014from infants to the elderly\u2014resulting in a wide spectrum of various clinical manifestations. COVID-19 might present different degrees of severity\u2014from mild or even asymptomatic carriers, even to fatal cases. The most common complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Fever, dry cough, muscle weakness, and chest pain are the most prevalent and typical symptoms of COVID-19. However, patients might also present atypical symptoms that can occur alone, which might indicate the possible SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this paper is to review and summarize all of the findings regarding clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients, which include respiratory, neurological, olfactory and gustatory, gastrointestinal, ophthalmic, dermatological, cardiac, and rheumatologic manifestations, as well as specific symptoms in pediatric patients."

        "context": "The novel SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) became a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The epidemiological picture is constantly evolving, and on 13 May, 4,170,424 cases and 287,399 confirmed deaths have been reported (WHO Report). People with COVID-19 infection may show several symptoms, including fever, cough, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, arthralgia, headache, diarrhea, and rarely arthritis [1]. COVID-19 clinical features range from asymptomatic patients to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction [2, 3]. Influenza symptoms are associated with a cascade of inflammatory mediators. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) levels in plasma and upper respiratory secretions directly correlate with the magnitude of viral replication, fever, and respiratory and systemic symptoms, including musculoskeletal clinical manifestations [4, 5] Musculoskeletal symptoms such as fatigue, myalgia and arthralgia are common COVID-19 symptoms, but their prevalence has not yet been systematically investigated [6, 7]. We collected the published clinical data of the past 5 months to ascertain the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms and epidemiological characteristics published worldwide in COVID-19 patients. Data were tabulated using Microsoft Excel 2020 V.16.34. The value was showed as mean \u00b1 SD. Student t test was used to reveal musculoskeletal symptoms between the total sample. To assess the incidence for each clinical variable, frequency analysis was performed. Regression analysis (R) was used to examine correlations between the total sample and musculoskeletal symptoms extracted. The level of significant was set at p < 0.05. The relevant reference and the data collected from the included articles are indicated in Tables 1 and 2. Data on 12,046 patients (54% male and 46% females) were available. The number of patients in the selected studies ranged from 5 to 1590 patients (223 \u00b1 312 patients). The sex ratio (male to female) was 1:15, and the overall average of patients was 52.13 years. The majority of the studies arose from China, mainly from Wuhan; one was from Singapore [57], two from Europe [46, 59], one from the USA [36], and one from Bolivia [58]. Musculoskeletal symptoms were present from the earliest stage of the viral illness and were reported in patients necessitating intensive care in the end stage of the condition. The total prevalence of fatigue symptom was 25.6% (R =0.56; p value = 0.004), while the prevalence of arthralgia and/or myalgia was 15.5% (R = 0.66; p value = 0.001; Fig. 1). Eight studies reported a prevalence higher than 50% of patients with fatigue [8, 9, 24, 25, 28, 37, 46, 47], while three studies reported higher values for arthralgia/myalgia symptoms [50, 53, 59]. The prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in studies from Europe reached high values [46, 59]; Lechien et al., for example, reported on 417 COVID-19 patients from 12 European hospitals and found myalgia in 246 (59%) and arthralgia in 129 (31%) of these patients [59]. Clinical presentation of COVID-19 ranges from absence of symptoms to severe pneumonia. Fever, dry cough and fatigue are common symptoms, as indeed are myalgia and arthralgia [6, 53]. Most of the articles are retrospective single center studies: data were collected in a non-homogeneous way, especially regarding comorbidities, lifestyle habits, and severity of the illness. Based on our work, we cannot state, for example, whether children and younger patients less commonly present musculoskeletal symptoms at onset [63]. Most studies originate from China, which is not surprising, and it is not clear whether the prevalence of musculoskeletal"

An increasing body of evidence suggests that patients with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) might have a heterogeneous spectrum of neurological symptoms A systematic search of two databases was performed for studies published up to May 29th, 2020. PRISMA guidelines were followed. We included 19 studies evaluating 12,157 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections. The median age of patients was 50.3 (IQR 11.9), and the rate of male patients was 50.6% (95% CI 49.2\u201351.6%). The most common reported comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes (31.1%, 95% CI 30\u201332.3% and 13.5%, 95% CI 12.3\u201314.8%, respectively).

        "context": "Background The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with common mental health problems. However, evidence for the association between fear of COVID-19 and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is limited. Objective This study aimed to examine if fear of negative events affects Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores in the context of a COVID-19\u2013fear-invoking environment. Methods All participants were medical university students and voluntarily completed three surveys via smartphone or computer. Survey 1 was conducted on February 8, 2020, following a 2-week-long quarantine period without classes; survey 2 was conducted on March 25, 2020, when participants had been taking online courses for 2 weeks; and survey 3 was conducted on April 28, 2020, when no new cases had been reported for 2 weeks. The surveys comprised the Y-BOCS and the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS); additional items included questions on demographics (age, gender, only child vs siblings, enrollment year, major), knowledge of COVID-19, and level of fear pertaining to COVID-19. Results In survey 1, 11.3% of participants (1519/13,478) scored \u226516 on the Y-BOCS (defined as possible OCD). In surveys 2 and 3, 3.6% (305/8162) and 3.5% (305/8511) of participants had scores indicative of possible OCD, respectively. The Y-BOCS score, anxiety level, quarantine level, and intensity of fear were significantly lower at surveys 2 and 3 than at survey 1 (P<.001 for all). Compared to those with a lower Y-BOCS score (<16), participants with possible OCD expressed greater intensity of fear and had higher SAS standard scores (P<.001). The regression linear analysis indicated that intensity of fear was positively correlated to the rate of possible OCD and the average total scores for the Y-BOCS in each survey (P<.001 for all). Multiple regressions showed that those with a higher intensity of fear, a higher anxiety level, of male gender, with sibling(s), and majoring in a nonmedicine discipline had a greater chance of having a higher Y-BOCS score in all surveys. These results were redemonstrated in the 5827 participants who completed both surveys 1 and 2 and in the 4006 participants who completed all three surveys. Furthermore, in matched participants, the Y-BOCS score was negatively correlated to changes in intensity of fear (r=0.74 for survey 2, P<.001; r=0.63 for survey 3, P=.006). Conclusions Our findings indicate that fear of COVID-19 was associated with a greater Y-BOCS score, suggesting that an environment (COVID-19 pandemic) \u00d7 psychology (fear and/or anxiety) interaction might be involved in OCD and that a fear of negative events might play a role in the etiology of OCD."

        "context": "BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a novel viral illness that has rapidly spread worldwide. While the disease primarily presents as a respiratory illness, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea have been reported in up to one-third of confirmed cases, and patients may have mild symptoms that do not prompt them to seek medical attention. Internet-based infodemiology offers an approach to studying symptoms at a population level, even in individuals who do not seek medical care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine if a correlation exists between internet searches for gastrointestinal symptoms and the confirmed case count of COVID-19 in the United States. METHODS: The search terms chosen for analysis in this study included common gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Furthermore, the search terms fever and cough were used as positive controls, and constipation was used as a negative control. Daily query shares for the selected symptoms were obtained from Google Trends between October 1, 2019 and June 15, 2020 for all US states. These shares were divided into two time periods: pre-COVID-19 (prior to March 1) and post-COVID-19 (March 1-June 15). Confirmed COVID-19 case numbers were obtained from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering data repository. Moving averages of the daily query shares (normalized to baseline pre-COVID-19) were then analyzed against the confirmed disease case count and daily new cases to establish a temporal relationship. RESULTS: The relative search query shares of many symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and constipation, remained near or below baseline throughout the time period studied; however, there were notable increases in searches for the positive control symptoms of fever and cough as well as for diarrhea. These increases in daily search queries for fever, cough, and diarrhea preceded the rapid rise in number of cases by approximately 10 to 14 days. The search volumes for these terms began declining after mid-March despite the continued rises in cumulative cases and daily new case counts. CONCLUSIONS: Google searches for symptoms may precede the actual rises in cases and hospitalizations during pandemics. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, this study demonstrates that internet search queries for fever, cough, and diarrhea increased prior to the increased confirmed case count by available testing during the early weeks of the pandemic in the United States. While the search volumes eventually decreased significantly as the number of cases continued to rise, internet query search data may still be a useful tool at a population level to identify areas of active disease transmission at the cusp of new outbreaks."

Methods: we enrolled 25 consecutive inpatients with COVID-19 pneumonia, who were admitted without gastrointestinal symptoms and a previous history of inflammatory bowel disease. Results: At admission, 21 patients showed increased FC with median values of 116 (87.5; 243.5) mg/kg despite absent gastrointestinal symptoms. We found a strong positive correlation between FC and D-Dimer (r = 0.745, p < 0.0001). Two patients developed bowel perforation.

The vast and rapid spread of COVID-19 calls for immediate action from policy-makers and in many countries, various lockdown measures were implemented. Here, we utilized nationwide surveys that assess COVID-19 associated symptoms to analyse the effect of the lockdown policy in Israel on the prevalence of clinical symptoms in the population. Daily symptom surveys were distributed online and included fever, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, anosmia and Ageusia. A total of 1,003,298 surveys were filled out to date. We used a single measure of symptoms, Symptoms Ratio (SR), defined as a weighted mean of symptoms found to be prevalent in COVID-19 patients. Notably, following severe lockdown measures, we found that between March 15 and April 22, the mean SR sharply declined by 78.9%, as did every individual symptom, including our most common symptoms of cough and rhinorrhea or nasal congestion, which decreased from 14.5% and 13.8% of the survey responders, respectively, to 2.4% and 2.5%. We also observed reduction in symptoms separately in the vast majority of cities in Israel. Overall, these results demonstrate a profound decrease in a variety of clinical symptoms following the implementation of a lockdown in Israel. As our survey symptoms are not specific to COVID-19 infection, this effect likely represents an overall nationwide reduction in the prevalence of infectious diseases, including COVID-19. This quantification may be of major interest for COVID-19 pandemic, as many countries consider implementation of lockdown strategies."

Seven databases were searched to collect studies about the clinical characteristics of COVID\u201019 from January 1, 2020 to February 28, 2020. Then, meta\u2010analysis was performed by using Stata12.0 software. A total of 38 studies involving 3062 COVID\u201019 patients were included. Meta\u2010analysis showed that a higher proportion of infected patients was male (56.9%). The incidence rate of respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome was 19.5% and the fatality rate was 5.5%. Fever (80.4%), fatigue (46%), cough (63.1%), and expectoration (41.8%) were the most common clinical manifestations. Other common symptoms included muscle soreness (33%), anorexia (38.8%), chest tightness (35.7%), shortness of breath (35%), dyspnea (33.9%). Minor symptoms included nausea and vomiting (10.2%), diarrhea (12.9%), headache (15.4%), pharyngalgia (13.1%), shivering (10.9%), and abdominal pain (4.4%).

Normal leukocyte counts (69.7%), lymphopenia (56.5%), elevated C\u2010reactive protein levels (73.6%), elevated ESR (65.6%), and oxygenation index decreased (63.6%) were observed in most patients. About 37.2% of patients were found with elevated D\u2010dimer, 25.9% of patients with leukopenia, along with abnormal levels of liver function (29%), and renal function (25.5%). Other findings included leukocytosis (12.6%) and elevated procalcitonin (17.5%). Only 25.8% of patients had lesions involving a single lung and 75.7% of patients had lesions involving bilateral lungs. The most commonly experienced symptoms of COVID\u201019 patients were fever, fatigue, cough, and expectoration. A relatively small percentage of patients were asymptomatic. Most patients showed normal leucocytes counts, lymphopenia, elevated levels of C\u2010reactive protein and ESR. Bilateral lung involvement was common."

        "context": "Background A rapidly evolving evidence suggests that smell and taste disturbance are common symptoms in COVID-19 infection. As yet there are no reports on duration and recovery rates. We set out to characterise patients reporting new onset smell and taste disturbance during the COVID-19 pandemic and report on early recovery rates. Methods Online Survey of patients reporting self-diagnosed new onset smell and taste disturbance during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 1 week follow-up. Results Three hundred eighty-two patents completed bot an initial and follow-up survey. 86.4% reported complete anosmia and a further 11.5% a very severe loss of smell at the time of completing the first survey. At follow-up 1 week later, there is already significant improvement in self-rating of severity of olfactory loss. 80.1% report lower severity scores at follow-up, 17.6% are unchanged and 1.9% are worse. 11.5% already report compete resolution at follow up, while 17.3% report persistent complete loss of smell, with reported duration being 1 to over 4\u2009weeks. This is reflected in the overall cumulative improvement rate of 79% patients overall in the interval between surveys. Conclusions A review of the growing evidence base supports the likelihood that out cohort have suffered olfactory loss as part of COVID-19 infection. While early recovery rates are encouraging, long term rates will need to be further investigated and there may be an increase in patients with persistent post-viral loss as a result of the pandemic. We further call for loss of sense of smell to be formerly recognised as a marker of COVID-19 infection."

The most common symptoms of patients are fever and respiratory tract involvement. In this report, we describe one patient with frequent seizures probably due to COVID-19 infection for the first time. Case Presentation: A 30-year-old previously healthy female was admitted with generalized tonic-clonic seizure in the neurology emergency room. The patient complained of dry cough five days before the admission. She had seizures (five times) approximately every 8 hours. Brain MRI was normal and chest CT revealed focal ground-glass opacities. The respiratory specimen was positive for COVID-19 using real-time PCR assay. The symptoms of the patient improved with anticonvulsive and antiviral medications. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case study to report an association between frequent seizures and COVID- 19. In our opinion, there is a hypothesis about this subject that the etiology of seizure may be due to encephalitis and invasion virus to the brain or toxic effect of inflammatory cytokines."

These are postulated to be related to the virus\u2019s use of ACE-2 receptors located on certain intestinal cells, cholangiocytes, and hepatocytes. This brief review summarizes the available limited data on digestive manifestations of COVID-19. A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients can present initially with only digestive complaints. The most common digestive symptoms are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Liver-related transaminases are elevated in a substantial proportion of patients, although generally only mildly elevated. Currently it does not appear that severity of digestive symptoms corresponds to severity of COVID-19 clinical course, however, more severe alterations in liver enzymes may correlate with worse clinical course. Given use of antiviral and antibacterial agents in sicker patients, drug-induced liver injury cannot be ruled out either in these cases. Although viral RNA can be detected in stool, it is unclear whether fecal-oral transmission can be achieved by the virus. As further data becomes available, our understanding of the digestive manifestations of COVID-19 will continue to evolve.\n \n"

We also review the recommended management of pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID\u201019 and the various pharmacological agents that are being investigated and may have a role in the treatment of this disease. At present, it does not appear that pregnant women are at increased risk of severe infection than the general population, although there are vulnerable groups within both the pregnant and nonpregnant populations, and clinicians should be cognizant of these high\u2010risk groups and manage them accordingly. Approximately 85% of women will experience mild disease, 10% more severe disease and 5% critical disease. The most common reported symptoms are fever, cough, shortness of breath and diarrhea. Neither vaginal delivery nor cesarean section confers additional risks, and there is minimal risk of vertical transmission to the neonate from either mode of delivery. We acknowledge that the true effect of the virus on both maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality will only be evident over time. We also discuss the impact of social isolation can have on the mental health and well\u2010being of both patients and colleagues, and as clinicians, we must be mindful of this and offer support as necessary."

        "context": "In December 2019, a respiratory illness due to a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was first identified in China. The respiratory illness due to SARS-CoV-2, termed COVID-19, is now a worldwide pandemic and has been identified in 183 countries and 266 073 people. Common symptoms of COVID-19 include cough, shortness of breath, and fever; disease ranges in severity from asymptomatic infection, mild disease (in 81% of patients), to pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death. Worldwide there have been 11 184 deaths associated with COVID-19, and the current data suggest that the elderly or those with comorbid conditions such as hypertension or diabetes are at the highest risk for mortality. Although intensive precautions to limit spread in China appear to be decreasing the number of new cases within China, the global number of infections continues to rise rapidly. Identification of COVID-19 in the United States has been challenging, given insufficient availability of testing supplies. Although, supplies and testing are starting to increase significantly in the United States, among countries affected by COVID-19, the United States has among the lowest testing per capita. The inability to test widely and quickly has hindered our ability to characterize the epidemiology of the disease, prevent further spread, and ensure the optimal use of other limited resources such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and medication therapy. Pharmacists play an essential and unique role within the healthcare team to optimize patient care during this COVID-19 pandemic. Antiviral stewardship is vital during the pandemic. In lieu of antivirals with established efficacy for COVID-19, novel experimental agents are currently being evaluated in controlled studies globally for the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19. One of the leading agents, remdesivir, was initially evaluated for the treatment of Ebola and is now being investigated for COVID-19 treatment, given its activity against RNA viruses. There are several ongoing trials evaluating remdesivir for COVID-19. The currently enrolling adaptive randomized controlled trial is particularly noteworthy, as the study compares remdesivir to placebo first, and if remdesivir is associated with improved outcomes, a new therapeutic agent will be evaluated with remdesivir as the control. A series of two-arm comparisons with new agents will occur with the aim of identifying the safest and most effective therapy for COVID-19. Naturally, pharmacists are essential in facilitating these investigational drug studies in health systems but they are also integral to helping obtain medication through compassionate use protocols. Remdesivir may also be obtained from the manufacturer (Gilead) under a compassionate use protocol. We have assessed patients in our own institutions for eligibility for this agent via compassionate use and have obtained it for one patient so far; this process requires obtaining authorization from the manufacturer and providing them with detailed clinical information about the patient, contacting the FDA to obtain emergency investigational new drug approval, gaining approval from the local IRB, coordinating with local investigational drug services, and obtaining patient consent. Gilead is now moving from compassionate use to expanded use protocols, highlighting the need to continuously monitor drug availability and approaches to obtaining medication. Identifying patients who may be appropriate for this or other investigational agents, collaborating with the physician sponsor and quickly coordinating with the other various parties, and receiving, preparing, and delivering drug to the patient's bedside are all key roles of the pharmacist during the COVID-19 pandemic. While investigational drug pharmacists play a significant role here, active involvement of those practicing in infectious diseases, information technology, critical care, distribution, and management can streamline the process and speed the time to therapy for study patients. While no agents are currently FDA-approved for treatment of COVID-19, a number of drugs approved for other indications and available in the US market are of great interest for repurposing for COVID-19 treatment. In vitro, these drugs may display direct antiviral effects, such as lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine; or may be immune-modulating agents, such as tocilizumab or interferons. Data supporting the use of these agents are often limited to in vitro studies, animal models, or case series. Pharmacists play an essential role in reviewing and interpreting this information for their clinician colleagues, particularly when physician colleagues may be experiencing increased patient volume and thus may have limited time to read and evaluate new data as they are published. While enthusiasm for any drug that could aid in this disease may run high, it is important to take an appropriately critical approach in evaluating risks and harms. This is particularly important given that there are no randomized controlled trials demonstrating the efficacy of any agent for the treatment of COVID-19. For example, while lopinavir/ritonavir has been considered to have great promise, a recent randomized trial was unable to show a clinical benefit when compared to the standard of care. Several randomized trials of these repurposed agents are recruiting, and encouraging enrollment in such trials is an important means of developing a scientific basis for their use. If these agents are used, it is the pharmacist's role to provide accurate data to the providers about safe drug delivery (eg, how to formulate oral drugs when patients cannot swallow), drug-drug interactions, and adverse effects.

        "context": "The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has made the COVID-19 disease a worldwide epidemic. The most common tests to identify COVID-19 are invasive, time consuming and limited in resources. Imaging is a non-invasive technique to identify if individuals have symptoms of disease in their lungs. However, the diagnosis by this method needs to be made by a specialist doctor, which limits the mass diagnosis of the population. Image processing tools to support diagnosis reduce the load by ruling out negative cases. Advanced artificial intelligence techniques such as Deep Learning have shown high effectiveness in identifying patterns such as those that can be found in diseased tissue. This study analyzes the effectiveness of a VGG16-based Deep Learning model for the identification of pneumonia and COVID-19 using torso radiographs. Results show a high sensitivity in the identification of COVID-19, around 100%, and with a high degree of specificity, which indicates that it can be used as a screening test. AUCs on ROC curves are greater than 0.9 for all classes considered."

As of April 13th, 2020, there have been approximately 1.9 million cases and 199,000 deaths across the world, which were associated with COVID-19. The COVID-19 is the seventh coronavirus to be identified to infect humans. In the past, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome were the two coronaviruses that infected humans with a high fatality, particularly among the elderly. Fatalities due to COVID-19 are higher in patients older than 50\u00a0years of age or those with multimorbid conditions. The COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets, with the most common symptoms being high fever, cough, myalgia, atypical symptoms included sputum production, headache, hemoptysis and diarrhea. However, the incubation period can range from 2 to 14\u00a0days without any symptoms. It is particularly true with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in which patients can still shed the virus even after pulmonary symptoms have resolved. Given the high percentage of COVID-19 patients that present with GI symptoms (e.g., nausea and diarrhea), screening patients for GI symptoms remain essential. Recently, cases of fecal\u2013oral transmission of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the USA and China, indicating that the virus can replicate in both the respiratory and digestive tract. Moreover, the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, treatments and prevention of the gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 remain to be elucidated."

This study provides a brief and precise review of the current knowledge regarding COVID-19, including disease transmission, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and potential treatment. The article focused on COVID-19-related information useful in otolaryngologist practice. Methods The Medline and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using terms \u201cCOVID-19\u201d, \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d in conjunction with \u201cotorhinolaryngological manifestation\u201d, \u201cENT\u201d, and \u201colfaction\u201d. Results The most common otolaryngological dysfunctions of COVID-19 were cough, sore throat, and dyspnea. Rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and dizziness were also present. COVID-19 could manifest as an isolated sudden hyposmia/anosmia. Upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms were commonly observed in younger patients and usually appeared initially. They could be present even before the molecular confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. Otolaryngologists are of great risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 as they cope with URT. ENT surgeons could be easily infected by SARS-CoV-2 during performing surgery in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion Ear, nose and throat (ENT) symptoms may precede the development of severe COVID-19. During COVID-19 pandemic, patients with cough, sore throat, dyspnea, hyposmia/anosmia and a history of travel to the region with confirmed COVID-19 patients, should be considered as potential COVID-19 cases. An otolaryngologist should wear FFP3/N95 mask, glasses, disposable and fluid resistant gloves and gown while examining such individuals. Not urgent ENT surgeries should be postponed. Additional studies analyzing why some patients develop ENT symptoms during COVID-19 and others do not are needed. Further research is needed to determine the mechanism leading to anosmia."

He was given antibiotics for infection of unknown source, subsequently refined to treatment for community-acquired pneumonia. Despite active treatment, he deteriorated with oxygen desaturation and tachypnoea. A repeat chest X-ray showed widespread opacification. A postmortem throat swab identified COVID-19 infection. He was treated in three wards over 5 days with no infection control precautions.

Although patients primarily present with fever, cough and dyspnea, some patients also develop gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatic manifestations. The most common GI symptoms reported are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort. Liver chemistry abnormalities are common and include elevation of aspartate transferase, alanine transferase, and total bilirubin. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infects the GI tract via its viral receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II, which is expressed on enterocytes of the ileum and colon. Viral RNA has also been isolated from stool specimens of COVID-19 patients, which raised the concern for fecal-oral transmission in addition to droplet transmission. Although indirect evidence has suggested possible fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, more effort is needed to establish the role of the fecal-oral transmission route. Further research will help elucidate the association between patients with underlying GI diseases, such as chronic liver disease and inflammatory bowel disease, and severity of COVID-19. In this review, we summarize the data on GI involvement to date, as well as the impact of COVID-19 on underlying GI diseases."

Methods: A systematic search was conducted using electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Scholar. All studies containing infected COVID-19 pregnant women who had given birth were included, and the search was done up to April 14, 2020. Results: Overall, 21 articles were reviewed, and clinical characteristics of 90 pregnant patients and 92 neonates born to mothers infected with COVID-19 were reviewed. The most common symptoms included fever, cough, and dyspnea. The main laboratory findings included leukocytosis, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated C-reactive protein. The most commonly reported complications were preterm labor and fetal distress. Three mothers were admitted to ICU and required mechanical ventilation; among them, one died, and one was on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Overall, 86 neonates were tested for the possibility of vertical transmission and 82 cases were negative in RT-PCR, while 4 were positive. Out of 92 neonates, one died, and one was born dead. Nineteen patients reported having no symptoms, while breathing problems and pneumonia were reported as the most common neonatal complications. Conclusion: There were no differences in the clinical characteristics of pregnant women and non-pregnant COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 infection has caused higher incidence of fetal distress and premature labor in pregnant women. Although the possibility of vertical transmission in infected pregnant women is rare, four neonates\u2019 test results for COVID-19 infection were positive in this review."

        "context": "To the Editor \u2014 We report the kinetics of immune responses in relation to clinical and virological features of a patient with mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that required hospitalization. Increased antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), follicular helper T cells (TFH cells), activated CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells and immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies that bound the COVID-19causing coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 were detected in blood before symptomatic recovery. These immunological changes persisted for at least 7 d following full resolution of symptoms. A 47-year-old woman from Wuhan, Hubei province, China, presented to an emergency department in Melbourne, Australia. Her symptoms commenced 4 d earlier with lethargy, sore throat, dry cough, pleuritic chest pain, mild dyspnea and subjective fevers (Fig. 1a). She traveled from Wuhan to Australia 11 d before presentation. She had no contact with the Huanan seafood market or with known COVID-19 cases. She was otherwise healthy and was a non-smoker taking no medications. Clinical examination revealed a temperature of 38.5 \u00b0C, a pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 140/80 mm Hg, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98% while breathing ambient air. Lung auscultation revealed bi-basal rhonchi. At presentation on day 4, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in a nasopharyngeal swab specimen by real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR. SARS-CoV-2 was again detected at days 5\u20136 in nasopharyngeal, sputum and fecal samples, but was undetectable from day 7 (Fig. 1a). Blood C-reactive protein was elevated at 83.2, with normal counts of lymphocytes (4.3 \u00d7 109 cells per liter (range, 4.0 \u00d7 109 to 12.0 \u00d7 109 cells per liter)) and neutrophils (6.3 \u00d7 109 cells per liter (range, 2.0 \u00d7 109 to 8.0 \u00d7 109 \u00d7 109 cells per liter)). No other respiratory pathogens were detected. Her management was intravenous fluid rehydration without supplemental oxygenation. No antibiotics, steroids or antiviral agents were administered. Chest radiography demonstrated bi-basal infiltrates at day 5 that cleared on day 10 (Fig. 1b). She was discharged to home isolation on day 11. Her symptoms resolved completely by day 13, and she remained well at day 20, with progressive increases in plasma SARS-CoV-2-binding IgM and IgG antibodies from day 7 until day 20 (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1). The patient was enrolled through the Sentinel Travelers Research Preparedness Platform for Emerging Infectious Diseases novel coronavirus substudy (SETREP-ID-coV) and provided written informed consent before the study. Patient care and research were conducted in compliance with the Case Report guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. Experiments were performed with ethics approvals HREC/17/MH/53, HREC/15/MonH/64/2016.196 and UoM#1442952.1/#1443389.4. We analyzed the kinetics and breadth of immune responses associated with clinical resolution of COVID-19. As ASCs are key for the rapid production of antibodies following infection with Ebola virus1,2 and infection with and vaccination against influenza virus2,3, and activated circulating TFH cells (cTFH cells) are concomitantly induced following vaccination against influenza virus3, we defined the frequency of CD3\u2013CD19+CD27hiCD38hi ASC and CD4+CXCR5+ICOS+PD-1+ cTFH cell responses before symptomatic recovery. ASCs appeared in the blood at the time of viral clearance (day 7; 1.48%) and peaked on day 8 (6.91%). The emergence of cTFH cells occurred concurrently in blood at day 7 (1.98%), increasing on day 8 (3.25%) and day 9 (4.46%) (Fig. 1d). The peak of both ASCs and cTFH cells was markedly higher in the patient with COVID-19 than in healthy control participants (0.61% \u00b1 0.40% and 1.83% \u00b1 0.77%, respectively (average \u00b1 s.d.); n = 5). Both ASCs and cTFH cells were prominently present during convalescence (day 20) (4.54% and 7.14%, respectively; Fig. 1d). Thus, our study provides evidence on the recruitment of both ASCs and cTFH cells in this patient\u2019s blood while she was still unwell and 3 d before the resolution of symptoms. Since co-expression of CD38 and HLA-DR is the key phenotype of the activation of CD8+ T cells in response to viral infections, we analyzed co-expression of CD38 and HLA-DR. As per reports for Ebola and influenza1,4, co-expression of CD38 and HLA-DR on CD8+ T cells (assessed as the frequency of CD38+HLA-DR+ CD8+ T cells) rapidly increased in this patient from day 7 (3.57%) to day 8 (5.32%) and day 9 (11.8%), then decreased at day 20 (7.05%) (Fig. 1e). Furthermore, the frequency of CD38+HLA-DR+ CD8+ T cells was much higher in this patient than in healthy individuals (1.47% \u00b1 0.50%; n = 5). CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells were also recently documented in a patient with COVID-19 at one time point5. Similarly, co-expression of CD38 and HLA-DR on CD4+ T cells (assessed as the frequency of CD38+HLA-DR+ CD4+ T cells) increased between day 7 (0.55%) and day 9 (3.33%) in this patient, relative to that of healthy donors (0.63% \u00b1 0.28%; n = 5), although at lower levels than that of CD8+ T cells. CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells, especially CD8+ T cells, produced larger amounts of granzymes A and B and perforin (~34\u201354% higher) than did their parent cells (CD8+ or CD4+ populations; Fig. 1e). Thus, the emergence and rapid increase in activated CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells, especially CD8+ T cells, at days 7\u20139 preceded the resolution of symptoms. Details on data reproducibility are in the Life Sciences Reporting Summary. Analysis of CD16+CD14+ monocytes, which are related to immunopathology, showed lower frequencies of CD16+CD14+ monocytes in the blood of this patient at days 7, 8 and 9 (1.29%, 0.43% and 1.47%, respectively) than in that of healthy control donors (9.03% \u00b1 4.39%; n = 5) (Fig. 1f), possibly indicative of the efflux of CD16+CD14+ monocytes from the blood to the site of infection. No differences in activated HLA-DR+CD3\u2013CD56+ natural killer cells were found. As pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are predictive of severe clinical outcomes for influenza6, we quantified 17 pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in plasma. We found low levels of the chemokine MCP-1 (CCL2) in the patient\u2019s plasma (Extended Data Fig. 2a), although this was comparable to results obtained for healthy donors (22.15 \u00b1 13.81; n = 5), patients infected with influenza A virus or influenza B, assessed at days 7\u20139"

        "context": "Background CT may play a central role in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 pneumonia. Purpose To perform a longitudinal study to analyze the serial CT findings over time in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Materials and Methods During January 16 to February 17, 2020, 90 patients (male:female, 33:57; mean age, 45 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were prospectively enrolled and followed up until they were discharged or died, or until the end of the study. A total of 366 CT scans were acquired and reviewed by 2 groups of radiologists for the patterns and distribution of lung abnormalities, total CT scores and number of zones involved. Those features were analyzed for temporal change. Results CT scores and number of zones involved progressed rapidly, peaked during illness days 6-11 (median: 5 and 5), and followed by persistence of high levels. The predominant pattern of abnormalities after symptom onset was ground-glass opacity (35/78 [45%] to 49/79 [62%] in different periods). The percentage of mixed pattern peaked (30/78 [38%]) on illness days 12-17, and became the second most predominant pattern thereafter. Pure ground-glass opacity was the most prevalent sub-type of ground-glass opacity after symptom onset (20/50 [40%] to 20/28 [71%]). The percentage of ground-glass opacity with irregular linear opacity peaked on illness days 6-11 (14/50 [28%)]) and became the second most prevalent subtype thereafter. The distribution of lesions was predominantly bilateral and subpleural. 66/70 (94%) patients discharged had residual disease on final CT scans (median CT scores and zones involved: 4 and 4), with ground-glass opacity (42/70 [60%]) and pure ground-glass opacity (31/42 [74%]) the most common pattern and subtype. Conclusion The extent of lung abnormalities on CT peaked during illness days 6-11. The temporal changes of the diverse CT manifestations followed a specific pattern, which might indicate the progression and recovery of the illness."

        "context": "Like other developed countries, Canada has an aging population, although less than most other G7 nations. Of a total population of 35 million people, 16.9% are aged 65 years or older (Statistics Canada, 2017a). Although the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can affect persons of any age, older adults are particularly vulnerable to serious infection and death (Verity et al., 2020) because of an age-related decline in immune function and the likelihood of having more preexisting health conditions than younger individuals (Nikolich-Zugich et al., 2020). Moreover, although only 5% of Canadian seniors live in longterm care homes (LTCH) (nursing homes) (Statistics Canada, 2017b), residents of LTCH have accounted for a disproportionate number of infections and deaths due to COVID-19 in Canada (Hsu and Lane, 2020). As of mid-April 2020, more than 40% of COVID-19-related deaths in Canada had occurred in LTCH (Hsu and Lane, 2020). Canada has a publicly funded, universally accessible, national health care system (\u201cMedicare\u201d), which provides Canadian citizens and permanent residents with prepaid medical care and hospital care. In addition, most drug costs, the basic costs of long-term care, and limited home care services are government funded for persons aged 65 years or older. As a result, there are no direct financial barriers to older Canadians\u2019 access to health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, as of April 12, Canada has been spared the massive disruption to its health care system that has occurred in some other jurisdictions such as Italy and parts of the U.S.A. (Weeks, 2020) and so mental health services, which may be vulnerable to such disruptions, have remained relatively intact."

        "context": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been causing significant challenges across all areas of society. By virtue of prevalent frailty and multimorbidity, care home residents remain vulnerable to COVID-19 until effective vaccines are developed (Gordon et al., 2020). The current health crisis and the enforced isolation can have huge impact to the mental health of this vulnerable individuals, the majority of whom have dementia and are also at significantly increased risk of severe COVID-19. At least two-thirds of care home residents and probably more than 80% have dementia (Prince, 2014). Ninety-eight percent of people living with dementia (PlwD) experience neuropsychiatric symptoms over the course of their disease (VikMo et al., 2020). With the ongoing COVID-19 viral pandemic, older people, especially PlwD and caredependent, may become more anxious, agitated, lonely, and depressed during the outbreak or while in isolation, with huge impact on quality of life, care burden, and use of resources. The increased morbidity and mortality in elderly and care home residents will further affect mental well-being with fear of illness and death in the residents. PlwD will be unable to understand the information on social distancing or to practice it. They will have confusion and distress around relatives not visiting. Limited social interaction and activities with fellow residents, families, and staff due to social distancing can also lead to boredom, inactivity, and sedentary behaviour in residents, further leading to loneliness. Both loneliness and social isolation have been linked to poor mental health (e.g., depression, hopelessness, and cognitive impairment), as well as worse physical health (e.g., worse motor function, cardiovascular health, disrupted sleep, frailty), and higher mortality (Leigh-Hunt et al., 2017; Santini et al., 2020). Imposed isolation can also result in sedentary behaviour which is critical in the prevention of physical, psychological, and social health problems (Maher and Conroy, 2017). It must also be frightening to PlwD when people approach them using personal protective equipment for interpersonal care (care home staff) or by health professionals. With current pandemic, there is a risk for increased use of antipsychotics, hypnotics, and other sedatives in residents with behaviour problems (such as wandering, agitation, or aggression) to ensure compliance with social distancing and to cope with staff shortage. Substantial work has been going on to optimise the use of medications especially antipsychotics, as they have harmful side effects in elderly and especially those with PlwD, and its increased use can double death rates and triple the stroke rates, with the potential to undomore than 10 years of significant progress in the rates of use (Kales et al., 2019; Romeo et al., 2019) and we have evidence from Randomised Controlled Trials and big data studies that the reduction in antipsychotics has led to 30% reductions in both mortality and strokes in this vulnerable population (Sultana et al., 2019). There is a serious concern that without proactive training and support in care homes, that the current pandemic will reverse all of this progress and also lead to significant increases in morbidity and mortality that compound the effects of COVID-19. We have demonstrated that the Well-being and Health for people with Dementia (WHELD) training programme to promote person-centred care and person-centred activities significantly improve quality of life for PlwD (Kales et al., 2019), as well as reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms and reduce the use of antipsychotic drugs, and recently demonstrated that an eLearning version of the programme also significantly improves the well-being of residents (McDermid et al., 2018). In the light of the pandemic, there is urgent need for innovative training interventions and non-pharmacological approaches for neuropsychiatric symptoms in PlwD that are person-centred, easy to deliver, and culturally competent to improve health outcomes within care home settings and avoid unnecessary hospital admissions during these tough periods of social distancing and isolation."

This commentary presents a set of recommendations to UN agencies, governments, donor agencies, academics and researchers and civil society, challenging these actors to work alongside people who use drugs to enact a new reality based on solidarity and cooperation, protection of health and restoration of rights and dignity and most importantly to mobilise to win the peace.\n \n"

It may have effects on both physical and psychosocial health, but studies considering the impact on vulnerable populations, such as people with chronic pain, are needed. In this cross-sectional study, an online survey of relevant chronic pain domains, coping strategies, triggers and potential related variables was answered by 502 Spanish individuals with chronic pain. Participants were mainly women (88%) with longstanding chronic pain and moderate to high pain intensity and disability. The perception of pain aggravation and the most pain-related outcomes were observed. Contextual variables such as job insecurity, worries about the future, people cohabiting, being close to someone who had passed away, or being potentially infected with COVID-19 were related to worse outcomes. More than half the participants altered their pain management style (e.g., increased medication intake) and several changes occurred with respect to pain triggers (cognitions, feelings of insecurity and loneliness, and sleeping problems were more frequently reported as triggers during lockdown). Our preliminary results highlight the negative effects of lockdown on patients with chronic pain as well as the need to make available cost-effective and remotely accessible healthcare resources for counteracting them."

Recently, few studies have claimed that warm weather can possibly slowdown the global pandemic, which has already affected over 1.6 million people worldwide. Clarification of such relationships in the worst affected country, the US, can be immensely beneficial to understand the role of weather in transmission of the disease in the highly populated countries, such as India. We collected the daily data of new cases in 50 US states between Jan 1\u2013Apr 9, 2020 and also the corresponding weather information (i.e., temperature (T) and absolute humidity (AH)). Distribution modeling of new cases across AH and T, helped identify the narrow and vulnerable AH range. We validated the results for 10-day intervals against monthly observations, and also worldwide trends. The results were used to predict Indian regions which would be vulnerable to weather based spread in upcoming months of 2020. COVID-19 spread in the US is significant for states with 4\u00a0<\u00a0AH\u00a0<\u00a06\u00a0g/m3 and number of new cases\u00a0>\u00a010,000, irrespective of the chosen time intervals for study parameters. These trends are consistent with worldwide observations, but do not correlate well with India so far possibly due the total cases reported per interval\u00a0<\u00a010,000. The results clarify the relationship between weather parameters and COVID-19 spread. The vulnerable weather parameters will help classify the risky geographic areas in different countries. Specifically, with further reporting of new cases in India, prediction of states with high risk of weather based spread will be apparent.\n \n"

Older adults, as well as people living with cancer, appear to be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality, which means that older adults with cancer are an especially high-risk population. This has led to significant changes in the way geriatric oncologists provide care to older patients, including the implementation of novel methods for clinical visits, interruptions or delays in procedures, and modification of therapeutic strategies, both in the curative and palliative settings. In this manuscript, we provide a global overview of the perspectives of geriatric oncology providers from countries across Europe, America, and Asia, regarding the adaptive strategies utilized to continue providing high quality care for older patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through these perspectives, we attempt to show that, although each country and setting has specific issues, we all face similar challenges when providing care for our older patients with cancer during these difficult times.\n \n"

Older adults are considered more vulnerable during public health emergency crises. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the psychological response of older adults during the acute phase of the pandemic in Greece. Method This cross-sectional study was part of a larger three-day online survey. A total of 103 participants over the age of 60 fulfilled inclusion criteria. The survey included sociodemographic questions and six psychometric scales: the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), the Brief Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12), and the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (JGLS). Results A significant proportion of the participants reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms (81.6%), moderate to severe anxiety symptoms (84.5%), as well as disrupted sleep (37.9%). Women reported significantly higher levels of COVID-19\u2013related fear, more severe depressive symptoms and sleep disturbances, as well as higher levels of intolerance of uncertainty. Participants living alone showed higher levels of loneliness. Intolerance of uncertainty was shown to modulate levels of loneliness. Conclusions During the quarantine, attention was promptly drawn upon the risks related with older people\u2019s loneliness. Studies identifying factors that may contribute to loneliness during a public health emergency facilitate the implementation of supportive interventions. Preparedness to address and manage older people\u2019s loneliness may limit this deleterious emotional response during the pandemic, as well as at the post-COVID-19 phase."

In response, this article uses thematic analysis to investigate 59 disability-related tweets from March 10 to April 4, 2020 that were retweeted at least 500 times, with a quarter of a million retweets altogether. This approach generates quick insights into widely resonating disability-related issues. The results suggest the value of Twitter for disseminating information about the risk, offers or requests for support, the ability of many people with disabilities to adjust to the changes well, and information about individuals with the disease. In addition, there was outrage at suggestions that the disease was less serious because young people without disabilities were relatively low risk, and that people with disabilities might be denied equal access to medical treatment. As one tweet pointed out, people in less vulnerable categories should not be told on Twitter or elsewhere that the disease is less relevant to them because their actions can impact others through social spreading."

        "context": "Significance Rural people have been left out of the vast majority of research on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, our evidence-based understanding of the pandemic in the United States is incomplete, and rural recovery policies risk being informed by anecdotal or urban-centric information. We begin to complete this picture by measuring and assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rural well-being in the North American West. Findings show there have been significant impacts on health-related and economic dimensions of well-being, and that these impacts are shared across sex, age, ethnicity, and education. Despite considerable social scientific attention to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on urbanized areas, very little research has examined its impact on rural populations. Yet rural communities\u2014which make up tens of millions of people from diverse backgrounds in the United States\u2014are among the nation\u2019s most vulnerable populations and may be less resilient to the effects of such a large-scale exogenous shock. We address this critical knowledge gap with data from a new survey designed to assess the impacts of the pandemic on health-related and economic dimensions of rural well-being in the North American West. Notably, we find that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on rural populations have been severe, with significant negative impacts on unemployment, overall life satisfaction, mental health, and economic outlook. Further, we find that these impacts have been generally consistent across age, ethnicity, education, and sex. We discuss how these findings constitute the beginning of a much larger interdisciplinary COVID-19 research effort that integrates rural areas and pushes beyond the predominant focus on cities and nation-states."

While efforts to contain the virus are vital to protect global health, these same efforts are exposing children and adolescents to an increased risk of family violence. Various criminological theories explain the causes of this new danger. The social isolation required by the measures taken in the different countries, the impact on jobs, the economic instability, high levels of tension and fear of the virus, and new forms of relationships have all increased levels of stress in the most vulnerable families and, therefore, the risk of violence. In addition, mandatory lockdowns imposed to curb the spread of the disease have trapped children in their homes, isolating them from the people and the resources that could help them. In general, the restrictive measures imposed in many countries have not been accompanied by an analysis of the access to the resources needed to reduce this risk. It is necessary to take urgent measures to intervene in these high-risk contexts so that children and adolescents can develop and prosper in a society which is likely to undergo profound changes, but in which the defense of their rights and protection must remain a major priority."

The datasets of confirmed and death cases of Covid-19 are taken into consideration. The recurrent neural network (RNN) based variants of long short term memory (LSTM) such as Stacked LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM and Convolutional LSTM are used to design the proposed methodology and forecast the Covid-19 cases for one month ahead. Convolution LSTM outperformed the other two models and predicts the Covid-19 cases with high accuracy and very less error for all four datasets of both countries. Upward/downward trend of forecasted Covid-19 cases are also visualized graphically, which would be helpful for researchers and policy makers to mitigate the mortality and morbidity rate by streaming the Covid-19 into right direction.\n \n"

Data measuring the longer-term impact of COVID19 on symptoms, radiology and pulmonary function are urgently needed to inform patients and plan follow up services. Methods: Consecutive patients hospitalised with COVID19 were prospectively recruited to an observational cohort with outcomes recorded at 28 days. All were invited to a systematic follow up at 12 weeks, including chest radiograph, spirometry, exercise test, blood tests, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaires. Findings: Between 30th March and 3rd June 2020, 163 patients with COVID19 were recruited. Median hospital length of stay was 5 days (IQR 2 to 8) and 30 patients required ITU or NIV, 19 patients died. At 12 weeks post admission, 134 were available for follow up and 110 attended. Most (74%) had persistent symptoms (notably breathlessness and excessive fatigue) with reduced HRQoL. Only patients with disease sufficiently severe to warrant oxygen therapy in hospital had abnormal radiology, clinical examination or spirometry at follow up. Thirteen (12%) patients had an abnormal chest X-ray with improvement in all but 2 from admission. Eleven (10%) had restrictive spirometry. Blood test abnormalities had returned to baseline in the majority (104/110). Interpretation: Patients with COVID19 remain highly symptomatic at 12 weeks, however, clinical abnormalities requiring action are infrequent, especially in those without a supplementary oxygen requirement during their acute illness. This has significant implications for physicians assessing patients with persistent symptoms, suggesting that a more holistic approach focussing on rehabilitation and general wellbeing is paramount.

Although the authors did not review the performance of individual screening tools, Ryu et al. reported that no evidence exists to indicate that screening has any substantial effect on preventing the spread of pandemic influenza. However, government officials continue to call for international airport screening guidelines as a crucial measure to control coronavirus disease. Therefore, differentiating between screening tools with poor technical performance and those approved for fever detection is worthwhile. For example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states that thermal scanners should not be used as standalone tools for fever detection (2). FDA instead recommends that officials use handheld infrared thermometers as screening tools. Thermal scanners use long-wave infrared to generate heat map images of persons and objects. This technology records surface temperature; however, fever determination requires a measurement of core body temperature. A study with 1,109 participants showed a correlation with core temperature of merely R2 = 0.41 for the most commonly used thermography region, the forehead (3). Performance of R2 = 0.69 was achieved only with overlaid standard camera video and complex free-form deformation models. Participants were assessed individually, after being seated for 15 minutes, without topical cosmetics or eyewear, at a stable ambient temperature and humidity, and without nearby infrared radiation sources. These conditions are rarely, if ever, met in the airport setting. Despite this evidence, costly thermal scanners have been deployed at airports in many countries. In contrast, inexpensive infrared thermometers are FDA approved for core temperature approximation. At their current performance, thermal scanners must be clearly distinguished from infrared thermometers, and thermal scanning should not be recommended for fever screening."

Within 28 days, 1404 (50.2%; 95% CI 48.3%, 52.1%) were discharged from hospital with a median duration of hospital stay of 9 (5\u201314) days, while 577 participants died (20.6%; 95% CI 19.2%, 22.2%). In multivariable models, younger age, routine metformin therapy and longer symptom duration on admission were positively associated with discharge. History of microvascular complications, anticoagulant routine therapy, dyspnoea on admission, and higher aspartate aminotransferase, white cell count and C-reactive protein levels were associated with a reduced chance of discharge. Factors associated with death within 28 days mirrored those associated with discharge, and also included routine treatment by insulin and statin as deleterious factors.

Methods: This was a retrospective observational study. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavisrus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive cases that were asymptomatic at admission were retrospectively enrolled. Specific clinical information, laboratory test results, chest CT imaging features and outcome data during hospital stay were collected and analyzed. Results: 137 non-consecutive asymptomatic patients with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in the present study. On admission, patients had no symptoms but chest CT findings were present in 61/137 (44.5%). Ground glass opacity (48, 78.7%) followed by ground glass opacity with crazy-paving pattern (9, 14.7%) were the commonest type of opacities with posterior, peripheral predominance and lower zone predilection. Among the initial CT positive group of 61 patients, follow-up imaging revealed progression of pulmonary opacities in 13/61 (21.4%), complete resorption in 21/61 (34.4%), partial resolution in 22/61 (36%) and no change in 5/61 (8.2%). The patients in progression group (54 \u00b1 19.7 years) were older and had higher frequency of co-morbidities (46.2%) compared to the other three groups (10.4%). The patients in progression group had a significantly higher C-reactive protein, higher lactate dehydrogenase and lower lymphocyte count than the other groups (all p-values < 0.05). The duration of hospital stay was longer in the progression group (27.1 \u00b1 11.4 days) compared to the other three groups (16.12 \u00b1 5.8) (p =< 0.05). Conclusion: Nearly half of the asymptomatic cases with confirmed COVID-19 had abnormal chest CT imaging. Asymptomatic infections can have a variable clinicoradiological course. Clinically, some recover without developing symptoms, some present few mild symptoms whereas some deteriorate. Similarly, imaging follow-up may reveal resolution (partial or complete), progression or no change. Advances in knowledge: Clinicoradiological course of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases is diverse."

During this time, a perceived decrease in hospital presentations nationwide was noted. This was also the experience of the Department of General Surgery, Bay of Plenty District Health Board (BOPDHB). We sought to quantify this reduction by analysing the frequency and severity of three common acute general surgical presentations; appendicitis, cholecystitis and diverticulitis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData on presentations of patients with appendicitis, cholecystitis and diverticulitis were retrospectively collected for the national lockdown period (25 March 2020-27 April 2020) and the immediate pre-lockdown period (21 February 2020-25 March 2020). Data collected included patient demographics, duration of symptoms, method of diagnosis, treatment, severity of disease, length of stay and complications.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA reduction of 62.2% was noted in the frequency of appendicitis during the lockdown period compared to the pre-lockdown period. Patients presented later during lockdown and had a higher complication rate (5.4% versus 42.8%). Similarly, a 39.2% reduction in presentations of cholecystitis during lockdown was found. The lockdown group of patients had a longer length of stay (6.9 versus 4 days) and only one patient (9.1%, 1/11) was managed with laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the lockdown period, compared to 52.9% of patients (9/17) over the pre-lockdown period. No difference in frequency or severity of acute diverticulitis presentations between the two periods was found.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe COVID-19 lockdown led to fewer presentations, but these were often delayed, with more complications and a longer length of stay. This could be partly explained by patient fear around exposure to the virus and reluctance to attend hospital. More research is needed to study the flow-on effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on surgical presentations."

We aimed to determine: 1)functional capacity of non-severe COVID-19 survivors by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET); 2)those characteristics associated with worse CPET performance. Methods We prospectively enrolled the first 150 consecutive subjects with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection discharged alive from March to April 2020 at Azienda Sanitaria Locale (ASL)3, Genoa, Italy. At 3-month from hospital discharge, complete clinical evaluation, trans-thoracic echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), pulmonary function test (PFT), and dominant leg extension (DLE) maximal strength evaluation were performed. Results Excluding severe and incomplete/missing cases, 110 patients were analyzed. Median percent predicted peak oxygen uptake (%pVO2) was 90.9(79.2-109.0)%. Thirty-eight(34.5%) patients had %pVO2 below, whereas 72(65.5%) above the 85% predicted value (indicating normality). Median PFT parameters were within normal limits. Eight(21.1%) patients had a mainly respiratory, 9(23.7%) a mainly cardiac, 3(7.9%) a mixed-cardiopulmonary, and 18(47.4%) a non-cardiopulmonary limitation of exercise. Eighty-one(73.6%) patients experimented at least one symptom, without relationship with %pVO2 (p>0.05). Multivariate linear regression analysis showed age ({beta}=0.46, p=0.020), percent weight loss ({beta}=-0.77, p=0.029), active smoke status ({beta}=-7.07, p=0.019), length of hospital stay ({beta}=-0.20, p=0.042), and DLE maximal strength ({beta}=1.65, p=0.039) independently associated with %pVO2. Conclusions Half of non-severe COVID-19 survivors show functional capacity limitation mainly explained by muscular impairment, albeit cardiopulmonary causes are possible. These findings call for future research to identify patients at higher risk of long-term effects, that may benefit from careful surveillance and targeted rehabilitation."

These infectious viruses have been identified as hemorrhagic fever viruses (Lassa, Ebola), novel coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS-CoV), and highly pathogenic influenza. Coronaviruses (CoVs), as a class of enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, cause various diseases in humans. CoVs are subdivided into four groups: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus (\u03b2CoV), Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. Two novel \u03b2CoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARSCoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), have recently emerged and can induce a high mortality. The current outbreak of novel coronavirus COVID-19 (HCoV-19 or SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring this outbreak a global pandemic. By March 15, 2020, infected cases had reached 81 048 in China and a total of 72 600 cases outside China have been reported to the WHO from 146 countries and territories (https://experience. a r c g i s . c o m / e x p e r i e n c e / 685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd). Similar to the SARS-CoV, symptoms of COVID-19 infection at onset of the illness include fever, myalgia, fatigue, and cough, and more than half of patients developed dyspnoea. Some patients had radiographic ground-glass lung alterations, and lower than average circulating lymphocyte and platelet populations. To date, the global deaths reached 5746, and the fatality rate was estimated as 3.7% for COVID-19 virus ( h t t p s : / / e x p e r i e n c e . a r c g i s . c o m / e x p e r i e n c e / 685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd), which is lower than that of SARS-CoV (10%) or MERS-CoV (37%). The major challenge of the coronavirus family and similar infectious agents is that no effective drugs or vaccine are available, and it may take many months for research and development. Human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 occurs when individuals are in the incubation stage or showing symptoms, while some individuals remain contagious while remaining asymptomatic (superspreaders). Transmission is thought to occur via touching infected surfaces (skin-to-skin, touching infected inanimate objects) then mediating the COVID-19 infection through the mouth, nose, or eyes. Transmission can also be through inhalation of exhaled virus in respiratory droplets. It has been reported that infectious viruses, including coronavirus, can survive for long periods outside of its host organism. COVID-19 virus is thought to survive for several hours on surfaces such as aluminum, sterile sponges, or latex surgical gloves, increasing the opportunity for transmission via touch. Transmission via the inhalation of small, exhaled respiratory droplets may occur as the aerosol droplets remain airborne for prolonged periods, mediating long-range humanto-human transmission via air movement. The relative contributions of large respiratory droplets, smaller airborne aerosol, or direct surface contacts to the transmissibility of COVID-19 still need to be evaluated to enable a fully effective control of transmission and infection. Faecal transmission routes should also be considered, as the COVID-19 virus has been positively detected in stool samples of infected patients. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV can"

        "context": "Background We observed a high number of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who had barotrauma related to invasive mechanical ventilation at our institution. Purpose To determine if the rate of barotrauma in patients with COVID-19 infection was greater than other patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation at our institution. Methods In this retrospective study, clinical and imaging data of patients seen between 03/01/2020 and 04/06/2020 who tested positive for COVID-19 and experienced barotrauma associated with invasive mechanical ventilation were compared to patients without COVID-19 infection during the same period. Historical comparison was made to barotrauma rates of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from 02/01/2016 to 02/01/2020 at our institution. Comparison of patient groups was performed using categorical or continuous statistical testing as appropriate with multivariable regression analysis. Patient survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves analysis. Results 601 patients with COVID-19 infection underwent invasive mechanical ventilation (63 \u00b1 15 years, 71% men). There were 89/601 (15%) patients with one or more barotrauma events, for a total of 145 barotrauma events (24% overall events) (95% CI 21-28%). During the same period, 196 patients without COVID-19 infection (64 \u00b1 19 years, 52% male) with invasive mechanical ventilation had 1 barotrauma event (.5% 95% CI, 0-3%, p<.001 vs. the group with COVID-19 infection). Of 285 patients with ARDS over the prior 4 years on invasive mechanical ventilation (68 \u00b1 17 years, 60% men), 28 patients (10%) had 31 barotrauma events, with overall barotrauma rate of 11% (95% CI 8-15%, p<.001 vs. the group with COVID-19 infection). Barotrauma is an independent risk factor for death in COVID-19 (OR=2.2, p=.03), and is associated with longer hospital length of stay (OR=.92, p<.001). Conclusion Patients with COVID-19 infection and invasive mechanical ventilation had a higher rate of barotrauma than patients with ARDS and patients without COVID-19 infection."

        "context": "Objective To survey the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and its influencing factors among patients with COVID-19 in their first medical follow up. Methods All patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were discharged from 12 hospitals in Wenzhou, Zhejiang from Jan 17, 2020 to Mar 20, 2020. Prospectively collected and analyzed data included demographics, clinical symptoms, comorbidity, and chest CT imaging features at the first follow up, 1 month after discharge. All patients underwent the HRQoL evaluation with the Chinese version of Short-Form 36-item questionnaire (SF-36) as well as a general condition questionnaire. Factors associated with SF-36 were constructed using linear regression. Predictors of impaired physical component summary (PCS) and a mental component summary (MCS) were identified by logistic regression. Results SF-36 demonstrated a significant difference in HRQoL in patients with COVID-19, except in physical function (PF), when compared to the general Chinese population (p<0.05). The multiple linear regressions demonstrated that age was negatively associated with PF, role physical (RP), but positively associated with vitality (VT) (p<0.05). PF, bodily pain (BP), and role-emotional (RE) were negatively associated with the female sex (p<0.05). For mental health, the clinical subtypes were significant associated factors (p\u200a<\u200a0.05). Length of stay (LOS) was strongly negatively associated with RE and RP, and positively associated with VT (p<\u200a0.05). Logistical regression revealed that non-obese overweight (OR 3.71) and obesity (OR 3.94) were risk factors for a low PCS and female sex (OR 2.22) was a risk factor for a low MCS. Conclusions Health-related quality of life was poor among COVID-19 patients at the 1 month follow-up. Patients suffered from significant physical and psychological impairment. Therefore, prospective monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 is needed in order to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, as well as to inform prompt and efficient interventions to alleviate suffering."

        "context": "It is unfortunately apparent that we are in the middle of an ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus disease that, according the World Health Organization, has now been characterised as a pandemic [1]. It appeared to have started in December 2019 when the first cases of pneumonia of an unknown cause were detected in Wuhan (Hubei, China) [2,3]. This led to a rapid outbreak due to a novel strain of the coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, which stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The associated disease, now referred as COVID-19, rapidly spread in mainland China and then in the rest of the world with some countries like South Korea, Iran and Italy particularly affected. According to the John Hopkins University dashboard, updated on 12th March 2020, there is an overall worldwide figure of 127748 total confirmed cases, 4717 total deaths and 68305 total recovered [3]. At the time of writing this editorial the figures suggest that COVID-19 infection causes mild disease (i.e. non-pneumonia or mild pneumonia) in about 80 % of cases and most cases recover, 14 % have more severe disease and 6% experience critical illness; the latter being more likely amongst high-risk groups such as the elderly and those with other chronic underlying conditions [4]. Authorities in many countries have improved health measures and in some cases restricted movement and large gatherings of people in order to limit the spread of the virus and prevent an overburdening of hospitals. Italy, was the first country in the world that adopted extraordinary measures on the entire national territory for a period of 2 weeks, such as closures of museums, schools, universities, sports centres and football matches [5]. On 11th March Italy underwent a complete closure of all commercial activities and shops, with some exceptions for goods of primary important such as pharmacies, grocery stores etc. At the moment the Italian population is being asked to stay at home unless there are important reasons related to work or to make essential purchases such as food and medicines, and other urgent purposes. Clearly, nosocomial transmission to other patients or hospital staff is an important concern [6]. However, evaluation of the coronavirus outbreak impact on other areas of clinical practice, not only hospital based, should be also addressed. Evaluation for specific health care professionals such dentists, obstetricians, ophthalmologists have been published [7\u201310]. Similarly in contact lens (CL) practice, the impact of outbreak is massive because CL practitioners are exposed to the infection and need to consider how they can play a role in preventing the transmission. According to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention [11] and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [12], the virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person via respiratory droplets transmission: an infected person produces droplets containing viable virus and relays them by sneezing, coughing, or exhaling. The droplets can make contact with the nose, mouth, eyes, or upper respiratory tract of another person through three main important routes (see Fig. 1) [13]. The first is an airborne transmission in case of close contact between people (within about 6 feet, about 1.8 m). The second is a direct contact transmission as when two people shake their hands and the contaminated hand then touches a risk area on the second person. The last source is an indirect contact transmission where an infected person touches a surface that is then touched by the second person. This latter route is due to the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 (as other coronaviruses) can survive for several hours on inanimate environments (e.g. objects surfaces) [14]. Although this is not considered the main way the virus spreads, it may be possible that a person can get the virus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and then touching own mouth, nose or eyes. It is currently thought that the virus can be transmitted when people who are infected are symptomatic, but sometimes symptoms are limited and a person may not realise they are infected, so some spreading of the virus might be possible before people show symptoms. Additionally, of particular concern for ophthalmic practitioners, it should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the tears and conjunctival secretions in COVID-19 patients with conjunctivitis [15]. This cannot exclude transmission by aerosol contact with the conjunctiva. Unfortunately, CL practice can be particularly exposed to these modalities of transmission. Indeed, CL practice involves face-to-face communication, close examination of the patient (distance between patient and CL practitioner during a slit lamp assessment is approximately 50 cm), need to directly touch patient\u2019s eyelids (for example during CL insertion/removal or push up test or lid eversion). Finally, some CL are still fitted using trial sets, which will need to be cleaned thoroughly between patients. Looking at available evidence in research papers, from the largest authorities in disease control and prevention around the world and from professional associations, there are at least 5 main areas of actions applicable in CL practice to minimise the transmission of COVID-19: patient management; personal protective equipment; disinfection of CL equipment and CL trial set; hands sanitisation; CL practitioner and staff monitoring. [9,11,12,14,16\u201321]. In term of patient management, efforts should be made to lower patient attendance to CL practices [9]. Each patient should be contacted by phone or email to explore the possibility of rescheduling non-urgent appointments. In the case of a patient attending an appointment it is important to evaluate the risk that the patient may pose, such as patients who travelled to outbreak areas within 14 days, patients with upper respiratory tract infection (e.g. cough), and patients with conjunctivitis [9,19,21]. If patients are deemed to have increased risk factors then it is more important to postpone the CL appointments for at least 14 days, which is the current understanding of the incubation period of COVID-19 [9].

        "context": "What were the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and patient cohorting on the mortality and care provided for patients with hip fractures? Mortality due to COVID-19 infection was higher before patient cohorting, and no nosocomial infections were detected after cohorting. Survival of patients treated in the COVID-19 circuit was similar to non-COVID-19 controls, in spite of longer surgical delay and length of stay. Separate circuits for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients allows adequate hip fracture care, without observing increased mortality when delaying surgery until stabilization among patients with severe respiratory illness. To analyze the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the provision of fragility hip fracture care, comparing patients treated before cohorting and in separate COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 circuits with the corresponding months in 2018 and 2019. Retrospective single-center cohort study including 64 patients with fragility hip fractures treated during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1st\u2013May 1st, 2020), compared to 172 patients treated in 2018 and 2019. Dedicated COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 circuits were established on March 14th. Patients treated before cohorting (17 patients), in COVID-19 (14 patients) and non-COVID-19 circuits (33 patients) were included. Baseline characteristics were similar for 2018\u201319 and 2020. Patients in 2020 had a lower median surgical delay (50.5 vs. 91.3 h) and length of stay (9.0 vs. 14.0 days), while those with COVID-19, had longer surgical delays and length of stay (87.7 h and 15.0 days, respectively). Thirty-days mortality was higher among patients before cohorting, but similar in Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 pathways compared to 2018\u201319 (7.1% and 3.0% vs 5.2%, respectively). 23.5% of patients treated before circuiting suffered coronavirus infectious disease-19 disease after discharge. Following separation, no secondary cases of coronavirus infectious disease-19 were observed. Separate circuits for patients with and without coronavirus infectious disease-19 provided adequate hip fracture care. We did not observe increased mortality rates among hip fracture patients with preoperatively confirmed or suspected coronavirus infectious disease-19, compared to negative cases and 2018\u201319. Delaying surgery among patients with severe respiratory illness until a favourable trend could be observed did not lead to increased mortality."

        "context": "Background Little is known about the long-term lung radiographic changes in convalescent COVID-19 patients, especially the severe cases. Purpose To prospectively assess pulmonary sequelae and explore the risk factors for lung fibrotic-like changes on six-month follow-up chest CT of survivors of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Materials and Methods 114 patients (80[70%] men; mean age, 54\u00b112 years) were studied prospectively. Initial and follow-up CT scans were obtained on 17\u00b111 days and 175\u00b120 days respectively after symptom onset. Lung changes (opacification, consolidation, reticulation, and fibrotic-like changes) and CT extent scores (score per lobe, 0-5; maximum score, 25) were recorded. Patients were divided into two groups: group#1 presence and group#2 absence of CT evidence of fibrotic-like changes (traction bronchiectasis, parenchymal bands, and/or honeycombing) based on their six-month follow-up CT. Between-group differences were assessed by Fisher\u2019s exact test, two-sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the independent predictive factors of fibrotic-like changes. Results On follow-up CT, evidence of fibrotic-like changes was observed in 40/114 (35%) of patients (group#1), while the remaining 74/114 (65%) patients (group#2) showed either complete radiological resolution (43/114, 38%) or residual ground-glass opacification or interstitial thickening (31/114, 27%). Multivariable analysis identified age >50 years (odds ratio [OR]:8.5, 95%CI:1.9-38, p=.01), heart rate >100bpm at admission (OR:5.6, 95%CI:1.1-29, p=.04), duration of in-hospital stay \u226517 days (OR:5.5, 95%CI:1.5-21, p=.01), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR:13, 95%CI:3.3-55, p<.001), non-invasive mechanical ventilation (OR:6.3, 95%CI:1.3-30, p=.02) and total CT score \u226518 (OR:4.2, 95%CI:1.2-14, p=.02) on initial CT as independent predictors for lung fibrotic-like changes at 6 months. Conclusions Six-month follow-up CT showed lung fibrotic-like changes in more than one-third of patients who survived severe COVID-19 pneumonia. These changes were associated with an older age, acute respiratory distress syndrome, longer in-hospital stays, tachycardia, non-invasive mechanical ventilation and higher initial chest CT score.
